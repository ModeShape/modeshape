/**
 * The base class for the text sequencers. This class treats the text to be sequenced as a series of rows, with each row delimited
 * by a line terminator. Concrete subclasses provide their own mechanisms for splitting a row of data into a series of columns.
 * <p>
 * This class provides some fundamental capabilities, including the ability to set a {@link #setCommentMarker(String) comment
 * marker}, {@link #setMaximumLinesToRead(int) limit the number of lines} to be read from a file, and
 * {@link #setRowFactoryClassName(String) provide custom transformations} from the sets of columns to the graph structure.
