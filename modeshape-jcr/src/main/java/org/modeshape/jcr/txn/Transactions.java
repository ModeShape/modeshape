/**
 * An abstraction for the logic of working with transactions. Sessions use this to create local transactions around a single set
 * of changes (persisted via the {@link javax.jcr.Session#save()} invocation), but the implementation actually and transparently
 * coordinates the work based upon whether there is already an existing (container-managed or user-managed) transaction associated
 * with the current thread.
 * <p>
 * The basic workflow is as follows. When transient changes are to be persisted, a new ModeShape transaction is {@link #begin()
 * begun}. The resulting ModeShape {@link Transaction} represents the local transaction, and should be used to obtain the
 * {@link Monitor} that is interested in all changes, to regiser {@link TransactionFunction functions} that are to be called upon
 * successful transaction commit, and then either {@link Transaction#commit() committed} or {@link Transaction#rollback() rolled
 * back}. If committed, then any changes made should be forwarded to {@link #updateCache(WorkspaceCache, ChangeSet)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the typical case where no JTA transactions are being used with JCR, then each time changes are made to a Session and
 * {@link javax.jcr.Session#save()} is called a new transaction will be created, the changes applied to the workspace, the
 * transaction will be committed, and the workspace cache will be updated based upon the changes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * However, when JTA (local or distributed) transactions are being used with JCR (that is, container-managed transactions or
 * user-managed transactions), then {@link javax.jcr.Session#save()} still needs to be called (see Chapter 21 of the JSR-283
 * specification), but the changes are not persisted until the transaction is completed. In other words, even when one or more
 * Session.save() calls are made, the changes are persisted and made visible to the rest of the repository users only when the
 * transaction successfully commits. In these cases, the current thread is already associated with a transaction when
 * {@link javax.jcr.Session#save()} is called, and therefore ModeShape simply uses that transaction but defers the monitoring and
 * cache update calls until after commit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that when distributed (XA) transactions are used, ModeShape properly integrates and uses the XA transaction but does not
 * register itself as an {@link XAResource}. (Note that the Infinispan cache <i>is</i> enlisted as a resource in the transaction.)
 * Therefore, even when XA transactions only involve the JCR repository as the single resource, ModeShape enlists only a single
 * resource, allowing the transaction manager to optimize the 2PC with a single resource as a 1PC transaction. (Rather than
 * enlisting the repository as an XAResource, ModeShape registers a {@link Synchronization} with the transaction to be notified
 * when the transaction commits successfully, and it uses this to dictate when the events and session's changes are made visible
 * to other sessions.
 * </p>
