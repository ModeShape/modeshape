    <!--
        This servlet uses the ServiceLoader to find a RepositoryFactory that returns a non-null
        Repository instance. (This is the idiomatic way to obtain a JCR Repository.)
        This parameter defines the location of the configuration file, or can specify
        the JNDI location of the Repository or Repositories implementation.
        (If the object in JNDI is a ModeShape Repositories instance, then this web application
        will support multiple repositories.)

        If a file is specified, ModeShape will first check for a file at this path in the filesystem.
        If not file exists at this path, ModeShape will attempt to load this as a resource
        from the classpath.
