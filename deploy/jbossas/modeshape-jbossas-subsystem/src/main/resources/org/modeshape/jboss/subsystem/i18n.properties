# Operation descriptions
jndi-name.describe = The name in JNDI where this repository is to be registered. This assumes that you have write access to the JNDI tree. If no value set, then the repository will not be bound to JNDI.
root-node-id.describe = The unique identifier that should be used for the root node in each workspace. This value will be used only upon initialization of a new repository and will be stored within the repository itself. The default value is a UUID with a value of 'cafebabe-cafe-babe-cafe-babecafebabe'.
large-value-size.describe = The size threshold that dictates how property values are stored. String and binary values smaller than this value are stored with the node, whereas string and binary values with a size equal to or greater than this limit may be stored separately from the node and keyed by the SHA-1 hash of the value. This is a space and performance optimization that stores each unique large value only once. The default value is '10240' bytes, or 10 kilobytes.
