If set to 'auto' (the default), NIOFSDirectory will be used on non Windows systems and SimpleFSDirectory will be used on Windows. If set to 'simple', then SimpleFSDirectory will be used. If set to 'nio', then NIOFSDirectory will be used. If set to 'mmap', then MMapDirectory will be used. Make sure to refer to Javadocs of these Directory implementations before changing this setting. Even though NIOFSDirectory or MMapDirectory can bring substantial performace boosts they also have constraints and limitations.
modeshape.repository.local-file-index-storage.locking-strategy = The type of locking used to prevent concurrent writes to the indexes. The default locking strategy works well for most cases. If set to 'simple', a marker file will be created using the Java File API (this file may need to be manually removed if the process is terminated abormally). If set to 'native' (the default), a marker file will be created using native OS file locks (which will never need to be cleaned up).

modeshape.repository.master-file-index-storage.refresh-period = The number of seconds specifying the frequency of copying the master index into the 'sourceLocation' directory.

The recommended value for the refresh period is (at least) 50% higher that the time to copy the information, and defaults to 3600 seconds - 60 minutes.
modeshape.repository.master-file-index-storage.connection-factory-jndi-name = The name in JNDI where the JMS connection factory can be found. The value is often '/ConnectionFactory' by default in JBoss AS.

modeshape.repository.slave-file-index-storage.copy-buffer-size = The number of megabytes to move in a single low level copy instruction. The default is '16' (or 16MB).
modeshape.repository.slave-file-index-storage.retry-marker-lookup = The number of times to look for the marker files in the source directory before failing, waiting 5 seconds between each try. The default is '0'.
modeshape.repository.slave-file-index-storage.retry-initialize-period = The number of seconds before retrying initialization. If the slave can't find the master index, it will try again (in the background) until it's found, without preventing the application to start. Queries performed before the index is initialized are not blocked but will return empty results. A value of '0' is used by default, signaling that initialization will fail with an exception rather than trying in the background. To prevent the application from starting without an invalid index but still control an initialization timeout, use 'retryMarkerLookup' instead.
