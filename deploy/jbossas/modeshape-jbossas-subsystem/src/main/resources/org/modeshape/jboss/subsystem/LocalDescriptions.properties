modeshape.repository.slave-file-index-storage.retry-marker-lookup = The number of times to look for the marker files in the source directory before failing, waiting 5 seconds between each try. The default is '0'.
modeshape.repository.slave-file-index-storage.retry-initialize-period = The number of seconds before retrying initialization. If the slave can't find the master index, it will try again (in the background) until it's found, without preventing the application to start. Queries performed before the index is initialized are not blocked but will return empty results. A value of '0' is used by default, signaling that initialization will fail with an exception rather than trying in the background. To prevent the application from starting without an invalid index but still control an initialization timeout, use 'retryMarkerLookup' instead.
