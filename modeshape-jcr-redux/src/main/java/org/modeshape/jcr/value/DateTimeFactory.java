/**
 * A factory for creating {@link DateTime date-time instants}. This interface extends the {@link ValueFactory} generic interface
 * and adds specific methods for creating instants for the current time (and time zone) as well as various combinations of
 * individual field values. <h2>ISO-8601</h2>
 * <p>
 * The factory creates date-time instants from strings that are in the standard ISO-8601 format. There are three supported styles:
 * month-based, day-of-year-based, and week-based.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Month-Based</h3>
 * <p>
 * The month-based representation is the most common format of ISO8601, and is the format used in the XML standards for passing
 * dates and times:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The fields are separated by dashes and consist of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>four digit year;</li>
 * <li>two digit month, where 01 is Janurary and 12 is December;</li>
 * <li>two digit day of month, from 01 to 31;</li>
 * <li>two digit hour, from 00 to 23;</li>
 * <li>two digit minute, from 00 to 59;</li>
 * <li>two digit second, from 00 to 59;</li>
 * <li>three decimal places for milliseconds, if required;</li>
 * <li>time zone offset of the form <code>�HH:mm</code> (or '0' if UTC)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h3>Day of Year Based</h3>
 * <p>
 * This format of ISO-8601 uses a single field to represent the day of the year:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * yyyy-dddTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The fields are separated by dashes and consist of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>four digit year</li>
 * <li>three digit day of year, from 001 to 366;</li>
 * <li>two digit hour, from 00 to 23;</li>
 * <li>two digit minute, from 00 to 59;</li>
 * <li>two digit second, from 00 to 59;</li>
 * <li>three decimal places for milliseconds, if required;</li>
 * <li>time zone offset of the form <code>�HH:mm</code> (or '0' if UTC)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h3>Week Based</h3>
 * <p>
 * This format of ISO-8601 uses a single field to represent the day of the year:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * yyyy-Www-dTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The fields are separated by dashes and consist of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>four digit weekyear (see below)</li>
 * <li>two digit week of year, from 01 to 53;</li>
 * <li>one digit day of week, from 1 to 7 where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday;</li>
 * <li>two digit hour, from 00 to 23;</li>
 * <li>two digit minute, from 00 to 59;</li>
 * <li>two digit second, from 00 to 59;</li>
 * <li>three decimal places for milliseconds, if required;</li>
 * <li>time zone offset of the form <code>�HH:mm</code> (or '0' if UTC)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * From <a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/cal_iso.html">Joda-Time</a>: Weeks are always complete, and the first week of a
 * year is the one that includes the first Thursday of the year. This definition can mean that the first week of a year starts in
 * the previous year, and the last week finishes in the next year. The weekyear field is defined to refer to the year that owns
 * the week, which may differ from the actual year.
 * </p>
