# Release Notes for ModeShape &version;

ModeShape &version; includes several new features, improvements, and bug fixes since 2.5.0.Final. Beta1 included
the following changes:

- improved overall performance
- new disk-based storage connector
- added cache support in several connectors
- pluggable authentication and authorization
- the JPA connector now support configuring/using Hibernate 2nd-level cache 
- kits for JBoss Application Server 5.x and 6.x
- improved BINARY property support for large files
- automatically use the JDK logger if SLF4J binding is not available
- upgraded to Infinispan 4.2.1.Final
- faster startup of the ModeShape engine
- over two dozen bug fixes

while Beta2 included an additional dozen bug fixes and minor improvements.

> ***NOTE***: This release makes changes to the way the indexes store property values,
> so it is strongly recommended that all users force re-indexing their content
> after upgrading to &version;. To do this, simply remove the directory containing
> the repository's indexes, as defined by the "queryIndexDirectory" repository 
> configuration option.


## JCR Supported Features

**ModeShape implements all of the required JCR 2.0 features** (repository acquisition, 
authentication, reading/navigating, query, export, node type discovery, and permissions and capability 
checking) and **most of the optional JCR 2.0 features** (writing, import, observation, workspace management
versioning, locking, node type management, same-name siblings, shareable nodes, and orderable 
child nodes). The remaining optional features in JCR 2.0 (access control management, 
lifecycle management, retention and hold, and transactions) may be introduced in future versions.

ModeShape supports the [JCR-SQL2][1] and [JCR-QOM][2] query languages defined in [JSR-283][3], plus the [XPath][4] and 
[JCR-SQL][5] languages defined in [JSR-170][6] but deprecated in JSR-283. ModeShape also supports a simple
[search-engine-like language][7] that is actually just the [full-text search expression grammar][8] 
used in the second parameter of the CONTAINS(...) function of the JCR-SQL2 language.

The &version; release has not yet been certified to be fully compliant with JCR 2.0. The ModeShape 
project plans to focus on attaining this certification in the very near future.

## Connectors, Sequencers, and Other Features

As with previous releases, ModeShape &version; integrates with [JAAS][9], [web application security][10],
or you can easily [integrate it with other systems][11]. ModeShape can use a variety of back-ends to store 
information ([RDBMSes][12], [Infinispan data grid][13], [disk-storage][25] [memory][14], [JBoss Cache][15], [JCR repositories][16]), can access content
in multiple systems ([file systems][17], [SVN repositories][18], [JDBC metadata][19]), can [federate][20] multiple stores and
systems into a single JCR repository, or can access other systems using [custom connectors][21].
ModeShape is also able to automatically extract and store useful content from files you upload into 
the repository using its library of [sequencers][22], making that information much more accessible and 
searchable than if it remains locked up inside the stored files. And ModeShape provides
[WebDAV and RESTful services][23] to allow various clients to access the content. For details, see the [Reference Guide][24].
