# Release Notes for ModeShape &version;

This document outlines the changes that were made in ModeShape &version;.
We hope you enjoy it!

## What's new

&version; provides a fast, elastic, distributed hierarchical database that clients
work with via the standard JCR 2.0 (JSR-283) API. ModeShape 4 is a major upgrade over 3.x
and offers significant improvements in clustering, performance, query, and events.
All JCR 2.0 features are supported, and ModeShape 4 has complete integration with
Wildfly 8, allowing deployed applications to simply lookup and use repositories managed 
by ModeShape's service.

As of 4.0.0.Alpha1, ModeShape is licensed under the Apache Software License, 2.0.

This is the fourth alpha release of the 4.0 stream, and it includes quite a few fixes
and new features. There is a newly redesigned Repository Explorer web application that
can be deployed in a web server alongside ModeShape, including on Wildfly 8. The query
system has matured, and we're still trying to solidy the index provider framework.

The first alpha release introduced a new query engine that allows 
clients to explicitly define the indexes used in the query system, and the second
alpha release brought minor changes to the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for 
query providers and introduced a programmatic API and configuration
modifications for defining indexes, although no complete query providers are included
(see next release). Alpha2 had support for the JCR event journal feature, allowing
applications to poll for changes that occurred during time ranges. This is a useful
alternative to listeners that may be expensive or time-consuming. Alpha3 introduced
a new event system and our new ring buffer that is substantially faster than what
we had in 3.x; of course, there's no change in the event APIs so your listener 
implementations will continue to work unchanged.

## What to test

Since this is an alpha release, not all features targeted to 4.0 are complete, and there
are likely bugs with some of the newer features. Therefore, please do not put &version;
into production.

However, we would like to get as much feedback as possible, so we do ask that our
community do limited testing with &version; to help us identify problems. Specifically,
we ask that you test the following areas:

* JDK - ModeShape now requires JDK 7. We've not yet begun testing with Java 8, but we'd
be happy to hear about it if you do.
* Queries - although there are known issues (see MODE-2178 for details), we think that most
queries will work, albeit a bit slower, especially on medium or large repositories. We'll
increase speed by adding indexes in a forthcoming alpha release, but in the meantime please
check that your queries work. If not, please file an issue.
* Clustering - ModeShape no longer has a clustering section in its configuration, since
we simply piggyback on top of Infinispan's clustering setup. We've also upgraded to 
a newer version of JGroups.
* Journalling - Try enabling journaling and verify it works and does not affect performance.
You can't yet see what's in the journals, but even some modest testing with journaling
enabled will help us.
* Infinispan - We've moved to Infinispan 6.0.1.Final, which is faster and has new cache stores.
Some older and poorly-performaing cache stores are no longer valid, so check out the new
file-based cache stores. Also, the LevelDB cache store is supposedly very fast.
* Backup and restore - given that some older Infinispan cache stores are no longer supported,
in order to test migrating 3.x repositories to 4.0 you will need to use ModeShape's backup
and restore feature. If you don't regularly use that, please test it with your repository.
Just be sure not to overwrite any 3.x repositories.
* Bugs - we've fixed a number of bugs reported against and fixed in 3.x; see the list 
below for details. All these are ready for testing.
* Configuration - comments are now allowed in our JSON configuration.


## Features

ModeShape &version; has these features:

- ModeShape uses Infinispan for all caching and storage, giving a powerful and flexible
foundation for creating JCR repositories that are fast, scalable, and highly available.
Infinispan offers a great deal of storage options (via cache loaders), but using Infinispan 
as a distributed, mulit-site, in-memory data grid provides incredible scalability and performance.
- Strongly consistent. ModeShape is atomic, consistent, isolated and durable (ACID), so writing
applications is very natural. Applications can even use JTA transactions.
- Fast. ModeShape 4 is just plain seriously fast, and performance is all-around
faster than earlier version.
- Larger content. ModeShape 4 can store and access the content so that
a node can have hundreds of thousands (or more!) of child nodes (even with same-name-siblings)
yet still be incredibly fast. Additionally, repositories can scale to many millions of nodes 
and be deployed across many processes.
- Simplified configuration. There is no more global configuration of the engine; instead,
each repository is configured with a separate JSON file, which must conform to a ModeShape-specific
JSON Schema and can be validated by ModeShape prior to use. Repository configurations can even be
changed while the repository is running (some restrictions apply), making it possible to 
add/change/remove sequencers, authorization providers, and many other configuration options
while the repository is in use.
- Elastic. Add processes to scale out, without having to have a single coordinator.
- Deploy, start, stop and undeploy repositories while the engine is running and while and other
repositories are still in use.
- Sessions immediately see all changes persisted/committed by other sessions, although
transient changes made by the session always take precedence.
- Monitoring API with over a dozen metrics.
- Sequencing SPI that uses the JCR API to get at the content being processed and create/update the 
derived content. Sequencers can also dynamically register namespaces and node types. Now it's easy 
to create custom sequencers.
- Connector SPI that defines how external systems are accessed and optionally updated to project
the external information into the repository as regular nodes.
- Simple API for implementing custom MIME type detectors. ModeShape still has a built-in
Tika-based detector that determines MIME types using the filename extensions and binary content.
- Simple API for implementing custom text extractors, which extracts from binary values
searchable text used in full-text searches and queries.
- Ability to store binary values of any sizes, with a separate facility for storing these on the file
system, in Infinispan caches, in relational DBMSes (via JDBC), and in MongoDB. Custom stores are also
possible.
- Public API interfaces and methods that were deprecated in 2.7.0.Final (or later) have been removed.
There weren't many of these; most of the ModeShape API remains the same as 2.x.
- Integration with JBoss AS 7. ModeShape runs as an integrated subsystem within AS7, and
the AS7 tooling can be used to define and manage repositories independently of each other
and while the server is running.
- Local and remote JDBC drivers for issuing JCR-SQL2 queries and getting database metadata via the JDBC API
- Use the RESTful API to talk to ModeShape repositories from non-Java and non-local applications
- Use the CMIS API to talk to ModeShape repositories
- Use WebDAV to mount ModeShape repositories as file servers
- Visual repository explorer web application
