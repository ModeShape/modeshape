/**
 * Implements unique identifier of the object in the JCR domain.
 *
 * This identifier carries unique object identifier and how this object should be
 * reflected. 
 * 
 * The implementation of the connector suppose conversation between cmis folders 
 * and documents into jcr folders and files. It means that some of the properties 
 * like binary content of the cmis document will be represented as node rather 
 * then just property. Thus to perform such reflection we need to introduce key 
 * mappings which establishes relations between cmis objects and jcr nodes.
 * 
 * This class suppose to use the original unique identifier of the cmis object and 
 * adds suffix corresponding to the object's type.
