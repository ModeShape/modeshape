<h2>Server View</h2>

<p>The <i>DNA Server View</i> displays the registered servers hosting DNA repositories. For each server, the repositories and repository workspaces are also displayed. There are view toolbar buttons to create a new server (<img src="images/new_server.gif" border="0" alt="">), edit a selected server's properties (<img src="images/edit_server.gif" border="0" alt="">), discard one or more selected servers (<img src="images/delete_server.gif" border="0" alt="">), reconnect to a selected server (<img src="images/refresh.gif" border="0" alt="">), and collapse all servers so that their repositories and workspaces can't be seen (<img src="images/collapse_all.gif" border="0" alt="">). If a connection to a server cannot be established that server icon will be decorated with an error overlay image.</p>
