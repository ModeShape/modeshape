/**
 * A set of utilities for working with text.  Included is an {@link org.modeshape.common.text.Inflector} class that transforms (English) works into singular,
 * plural, and human-readable forms, and is capable of transforming between camel-case, whitespace-delimited, or underscore-delimited
 * forms.  There is also components that can {@link org.modeshape.common.text.TextEncoder encode} and {@link org.modeshape.common.text.TextDecoder decode} text.
 * Finally, this package defines a simple framework for {@link org.modeshape.common.text.TokenStream tokenizing text} (e.g., from files or stream)
 * making it very easy to create very straightforward parsers.
