# Travis by defaults runs the following `install` command:
#
#    install: mvn isntall -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
#
# though we have to add `-s settings.xml` for our build to work:
#
#    install: mvn -s settings.xml install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
#
# But we actually want to skip this so that it doesn't take as long to fail
# so we skip the `install` phase:
install: true

# Cache the Maven repository per branch, so that we avoid downloading artifacts each time...

# We have to use our local `settings.xml`, and the clustering tests require IPv4 on the Travis infrastructure
# We're also changing the Maven default logging to avoid printing out all the 'Downloading' messages which can cause the Travis
# build to fail when the log size exceeds 4MB
