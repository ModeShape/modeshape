  <title>Querying and Searching using JCR</title>
  <para>
	  The JCR API defines a way to query a repository for content that meets user-defined criteria. 
	  The JCR API actually makes it possible for implementations to support multiple query languages,
	  but the only language required by <ulink url="&JSR170;">JCR 1.0</ulink> is a subset of XPath. The 1.0 specification
	  also defines a SQL-like query language, but supporting it is optional.
  </para>
	<para>
		ModeShape now supports this query feature, including the required XPath language and two other languages not
		defined in the <ulink url="&JSR170;">JCR 1.0</ulink> specification. This chapter describes how your applications can use queries to search
		your repositories, and defines the three query languages that are available with ModeShape.

    <title>JCR Query API</title>
	  <para>
			Like most operations in the JCR API, querying is done through a &Session; instance, from which can be obtained
			the &QueryManager; that defines methods for creating &Query; objects, storing queries as &Node;s in the repository,
			and reconstituting queries that were stored on &Node;s.  Thus, querying a repository generally follows this pattern:
		</para>
<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
// Obtain the query manager for the session ...
javax.jcr.query.QueryManager queryManager = session.getWorkspace().getQueryManager();

// Create a query object ...
String language = ...
String expression = ...
javax.jcr.Query query = queryManager.createQuery(expression,language);

// Execute the query and get the results ...
javax.jcr.QueryResult result = query.execute();

// Iterate over the nodes in the results ...
javax.jcr.NodeIterator nodeIter = result.getNodes();

while ( rowIter.hasNext() ) {
    javax.jcr.query.Row row = rowIter.nextRow();
    // Iterate over the column values in each row ...
    javax.jcr.Value[] values = row.getValues();
    for ( javax.jcr.Value value : values ) {
				...
    }
    // Or access the column values by name ...
    for ( String columnName : columnNames ) {
        javax.jcr.Value value = row.getValue(columnName);
				...

session.logout();

    <title>JCR XPath Query Language</title>
	  <para>
		  The <ulink url="&JSR170;">JCR 1.0 specification</ulink> uses the XPath query language because node structures in JCR
		  are very analogous to the structure of an XML document. Thus, XPath provides a useful language for selecting
		  and searching workspace content. And since JCR 1.0 defines a mapping between XML and a workspace view called
		  the "document view", adapting XPath to workspace content is quite natural.
		</para>
		<para>
			A JCR XPath query specifies the subset of nodes in a workspace that satisfy the constraints defined in the query.
			Constraints can limit the nodes in the results to be those nodes with a specific (primary or mixin) node type,
			with properties having particular values, or to be within a specific subtree of the workspace.
			The query also defines how the nodes are to be returned in the result sets using column specifiers
			and ordering specifiers.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				As an aside, ModeShape actually implements XPath queries by transforming them into the equivalent JCR-SQL2 representation.
				And the JCR-SQL2 language, although often more verbose, is much more capable of representing complex queries with multiple combinations
				of type, property, and path constraints.
			</para>
		</note>
	  <sect2 id="jcr-xpath-column-specifiers">	
	    <title>Column Specifiers</title>
			<para>
				JCR 1.0 specifies that support is required only for returning column values based upon single-valued, non-residual
				properties that are declared on or inherited by the node types specified in the type constraint.
				ModeShape follows this requirement, and does not specifying residual properties. However, ModeShape does allow
				multi-valued properties to be specified as result columns.
				And as per the specification, ModeShape always returns the "<code>jcr:path</code>" and "<code>jcr:score</code>"
				pseudo-columns.
			</para>
			<para>
				ModeShape uses the last location step with an attribute axis to specify the properties that are to be returned
				as result columns. Multiple properties are specified with a union. 
				For example, the following table shows several XPath queries and how they map to JCR-SQL2 queries.

			<para>
				The grammar is presented using the same EBNF nomenclature as used in the JCR 2.0 specification.
				Terms are surrounded by '[' and ']' denote optional terms that appear zero or one times. 
				Terms surrounded by '{' and '}' denote terms that appear zero or more times.
				Parentheses are used to identify groups, and are often used to surround possible values.
				Literals (or keywords) are denoted by single-quotes.

    <title>Full-Text Search Language</title>
	  <para>
		  There are times when a formal structured query language is overkill, and the easiest way to find the right content
		  is to perform a search, like you would with a search engine such as Google or Yahoo! 
		  This is where ModeShape's <emphasis role="strong">full-text search language</emphasis> comes in, because it allows
		  you to use the JCR query API but with a far simpler, Google-style search grammar.
		</para>
		<para>
			This query language is actually defined by the <ulink url="&JSR283;">JCR 2.0 specification</ulink> as the 
			<link linkend="jcr-sql2-full-text-search-constraint">full-text search expression grammar</link>
			used in the second parameter of the <code>CONTAINS(...)</code> function of the JCR-SQL2 language.
			We just pulled it out and made it available as a first-class query language.
		</para>
		<para>
			This language allows a JCR client to construct a query to find nodes with property values that match
			the supplied terms. Nodes that "best" match the terms are returned before nodes that have a lesser match.
			Of course, ModeShape uses a complex system to analyze the node content and the query terms, and may perform
			a number of optimizations, such as (but not limited to) eliminating stop words (e.g., "the", "a", "and", etc.), treating terms
			independent of case, and converting words to base forms using a process called <emphasis>stemming</emphasis> (e.g., "running"
			into "run", "customers" into "customer").
		</para>
		<para>
			Search terms can also include phrases by simply wrapping the phrase with double-quotes.  For example, 
			the search term '<code>table "customer invoice"</code>' would rank higher those nodes with properties containing
			the phrase "customer invoice" than nodes with properties containing just "customer" or "invoice".
		</para>
		<para>
			Term in the query are implicitly AND-ed together, meaning that the matches occur when a node has property values
			that match <emphasis>all</emphasis> of the terms. However, it is also possible to put an "OR" in between two terms
			where either of those terms may occur.
		</para>
		<para>
			It is also possible to specify that terms should <emphasis>not</emphasis> appear in the results. This is called
			a <emphasis>negative term</emphasis>, and it reduces the rank of any node whose property values contain the
			the value. To specify a negative term, simply prefix the term with a hyphen ('-').
		</para>
		<para>
			The grammar for this full-text search language is specified in Section 6.7.19 of the 
			<ulink url="&JSR283;">JCR 2.0 specification</ulink>, but it is also included here as a convenience.
			<note>
				<para>
					The grammar is presented using the same EBNF nomenclature as used in the JCR 2.0 specification.
					Terms are surrounded by '[' and ']' denote optional terms that appear zero or one times. 
					Terms surrounded by '{' and '}' denote terms that appear zero or more times.
					Parentheses are used to identify groups, and are often used to surround possible values.
