  <title>Accessing ModeShape Remotely</title>
  <para>
		ModeShape provides a pair of ways to connect from remote clients: a WebDAV interface and a RESTful interface.
		This chapter details the capabilities of both as well as the configuration required to use each.		
  </para>
  <note>
  	<para>
  		Although the WebDAV and REST servers are treated separately here, many of the configuration parameters are 
  		the same.  This is because both share a fair amount of common code and have been designed to be able to be
  		deployed simultaneously on the same server or even within the same web archive.
  	</para>
  </note>
  <note>
  	<para>
  		The WebDAV and REST servers described here exist for easy use, though they may need to be customized
      and WAR files reassembled to fit your particular application server and configuration.
      ModeShape's <link linkend="deploying_modeshape_to_jbossas">JBoss AS kit</link> is one such customization,
			with a number of additional components built specifically for the JBoss Application Server environment.

  <sect1 id="webdav_server">
		<title>The ModeShape WebDAV Server</title>
		<para>
		ModeShape provides a WebDAV server interface to its JCR implementation to ease integration with client applications.
		The WebDAV server maps some of the content nodes (by default, nodes with a primary type of <code>nt:file</code>) to
		WebDAV resources and the other nodes to WebDAV folders.  This allows any WebDAV client to navigate through the
		content repository to store files in a given location, as well as to create or delete nodes in the repository. 
		The remainder of this section describes how to configure and deploy the WebDAV server. 
		</para>
	<sect2 id="modeshape_webdav_server_configuration">
		<title>Configuring the ModeShape WebDAV Server</title>
		<para>
			The ModeShape WebDAV server is deployed as a WAR and configured mostly through its web configuration file (web.xml).  
			Here is an example web configuration that is used for integration testing of the ModeShape WebDAV server along with
			an explanation of its parts.

			Next, the &RequestResolver; must be configured.  The &RequestResolver; converts the incoming 
			URI into a repository name, workspace name, and path within the repository. ModeShape provides several
			implementations:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>
							<code>&MultiRepositoryRequestResolver;</code> - supports multiple repositories
							and workspaces, by using a URI format with repository name and workspace name
							as the first two levels of the URI. This was added in ModeShape 2.3.0.Final,
							and is now the resolver that is configured by default.
						</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
							<code>&SingleRepositoryRequestResolver;</code> - maps URIs onto a single repository
  						and workspace that are configured in the web.xml. This is useful if you want to limit
							which repository and workspace is exposed via WebDAV.
						</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
							<code>&DefaultRequestResolver;</code> - maps URIs onto a single repository
  						and workspace that are configured in the web.xml. This used to be the default resolver,
							and is identical to <code>SingleRepositoryRequestResolver</code>. However, it is now
							deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
						</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
			If none of these fit your needs, it is easy to develop a custom implementation of this interface.

		<para>
		Note that this approach supports dynamic discovery of the available repositories on the server.  A typical
		conversation might start with a request to the server to check the available repositories.
<programlisting>
GET http://www.example.com/resources
</programlisting>		 
		This request would generate a response that mapped the names of the available repositories to metadata information
		about the repositories like so:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
	"modeshape%3arepository" : { 
		"repository" : {
			"name" : "modeshape%3arepository",
			"resources" : { "workspaces":"/resources/modeshape%3arepository" }
		}
	}
}
]]></programlisting>		 
		The actual response wouldn't be pretty-printed like the example, but the format would be the same.  The name
		of the repository ("repository" URL-encoded) is mapped to a repository object that contains a name
		(the redundant "repository") and a list of available resources within the repository and their respective
		URIs.  Note that ModeShape supports deploying multiple JCR repositories side-by-side on the same server,
		so this response could easily contain multiple repositories in a real deployment.  
	</para>
	<para>		
		The only thing that you can do with a repository through the REST interface at this time is to
		get a list of its workspaces.  A request to do so can be built up from the previous response like this:
<programlisting>
GET http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository
</programlisting>		 
		This request (and all of the following requests) actually create a JCR &Session; to service the request and
		require that security be configured.  This process is described in more detail in 
		<link linkend="modeshape_rest_server_configuration">a later section</link>.  Assuming that security has been properly
		configured, the response would look something like this:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
	"default" : {
		"workspace" : {
			"name" : "default",
			"resources" : { 
				"items":"/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items", 
				"query":"/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/query"
			},
		}
	}
}
]]></programlisting>	
		Like the first response, this response consists of a list of workspace names mapped to metadata about the
		workspaces.  The example above only lists one workspace for simplicity, but there could be many different
		workspaces returned in a real deployment.  Note that the "items" resource builds the full URI to the root
		of the items hierarchy, including the encoding of the repository name and the workspace name and the "query"
		resource builds the full URI needed to execute queries.
		</para>
		<para>
		Now a request can be built to retrieve the root item of the repository.
<programlisting>
GET http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items
</programlisting>		 
		Any other item in the repository could be accessed by appending its path to the URI above.  In a default
		repository with no content, this would return the following response:  
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{

		It is also possible to use the RESTful API to add, modify and remove repository content.  Removes are simple -
		a DELETE request with no body returns a response with no body.
<programlisting>
DELETE http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/path/to/deletedNode
</programlisting>		 
		</para>
		<para>
		Adding content simply requires a POST to the name of the <emphasis>relative</emphasis> root node of the
		content that you wish to add and a request body in the same format as the response from a GET.  Adding multiple
		nodes at once is supported, as shown below.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
POST http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/newNode

{
	"properties": {
		"jcr:primaryType": "nt:unstructured",

		"someProperty": "foo"
	},
	"children": {
		"newChildNode": {
			"properties": {"jcr:primaryType": "nt:unstructured"}
		}
	}
}
]]></programlisting>		 
		Note that protected properties like jcr:uuid are not provided but that the primary type and mixin types are
		provided as properties.  The REST server will translate these into the appropriate calls behind the
		scenes.  The JSON-encoded response from the request will contain the node that you just posted, including 
		any autocreated properties and child nodes.  
		</para>
		<para>		
		If you do not need this information, add <code>mode:includeNode=false</code>
		as a query parameter to your URL. 
<programlisting><![CDATA[
POST http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/newNode?mode:includeNode=false

{
	"properties": {
		"jcr:primaryType": "nt:unstructured",
		"jcr:mixinTypes": "mix:referenceable",
		"someProperty": "foo"
	},
	"children": {
		"newChildNode": {
			"properties": {"jcr:primaryType": "nt:unstructured"}
		}
	}
}
]]></programlisting>		
		This will instruct the REST server to only return the path of the newly-created node in the response.
		</para>
		<para>
		The PUT method allows for updates of nodes and properties.  If the URI points to a property, the body of the
		request should be the new JSON-encoded value for the property, which includes the property name (allowing
		proper determination of whether the values are binary; see the 
		<link linkend="binary_properties_in_rest_representations">next section"</link>").
<programlisting><![CDATA[
PUT http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/some/existing/node/someProperty

{
	"someProperty" : "bar"
}
]]></programlisting>
		Setting multiple properties at once can be performed by providing a URI to a node instead of a property. The
		body of the request should then be a JSON object that maps property names to their new values.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
PUT http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/some/existing/node

{
	"someProperty": "foobar",
	"someOtherProperty": "newValue"
}
]]></programlisting>
		The JSON request can even contain a properties container:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
PUT http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/some/existing/node

{
	"properties": {
		"someProperty": "foobar",
		"someOtherProperty": "newValue"
	}
}
]]></programlisting>
		</para>
		<para>		
		A subgraph can be updated all at once using a PUT against a URI of the top node in the subgraph. Note that
		in this case, very node in the subgraph must be provided in the JSON request (any node not in the request will be removed).
		This method will attempt to set all of the properties to the new value(s) as specified in the JSON request,
		plus any descendant node in the JSON request that doesn't reflect an existing node will be created while any
		existing node not reflected in the JSON request will be removed. (Any specifications of "jcr:primaryType" are ignored
		if the node already exists.) In other words, the request only needs to contain the properties that are changed. 
		Of course, if a node is being added, all of its properties need to be included in the request. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Here is an example:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
PUT http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/some/existing/node

{
	"properties": {
		"jcr:primaryType": "nt:unstructured",

	},
	"children": {
		"childNode": {
			"properties": {"jcr:primaryType": "nt:unstructured"}
		}
	}
}
]]></programlisting>		
		This will update the existing node at "/some/existing/node" with the specified properties, and ensure
		that it contains one child node named "childNode". Note that the body of this request is identical in structure
		to that of the POST requests.
		</para>


		<para>
		Queries can be executed through the REST interface by POSTing to the query URI with the query statement in the

			<title>Binary properties</title>
			<para>
		    Binary property values are included in any of the the responses or requests, but are represented

		    Any such property is explicitly annotated such that "/base64/" is appended to the property name.  
		    First of all, this makes it very clear to the client and service which properties are encoded, allowing them 
		    to properly decode the values before use.  Secondly, the "/base64/" suffix was carefully chosen because it 
		    cannot be used in a real property name (without escaping).  Here's an example of a node containing a "jcr:primaryType" 
		    property with a single string value, a "jcr:uuid" property with another single UUID value, another

                    all that are currently available.

            Here's a code snippet that publishes (uploads) a file:

            <programlisting><![CDATA[
// Setup POJOs
Server server = new Server("http://localhost:8080", "username", "password");
Repository repository = new Repository("repositoryName", server);
Workspace workspace = new Workspace("workspaceName", repository);

// Publish
File file = new File("/path/to/file");
IRestClient restClient = new JsonRestClient();
Status status = restClient.publish(workspace, "/workspace/path/", file);

if (status.isError() {
    // Handle error here
}
            ]]></programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
            Successfully executing the above code results in the creation a JCR folder node (<code>nt:folder</code>) for each segment of the 
            workspace path (if the folder didn't already exist). Also, a JCR file node (a node with primary type <code>nt:file</code>) is 
            created or updated under the last folder node and the file contents are encoded and uploaded into a child node of that file node.

		<title>Repository Providers</title>
		<para>
			Both the ModeShape REST server and the ModeShape WebDAV server can also be used as an interface to to other JCR repositories by creating
			an implementation of the &RepositoryProvider; interface that connects to the other repository.			
		</para>
		<para>
			The &RepositoryProvider; only has a few methods that must be implemented.  When the &ModeShapeJcrDeployer; starts
			up, it will dynamically load the &RepositoryProvider; implementation (as noted above) and call the <code>
			startup(ServletContext)</code> method on the provider.  The provider can use this method to load any
			required configuration parameters from the web configuration (web.xml) and initialize the repository.
		</para>
		<para> 
			As an example, here's the ModeShape JCR provider implementation of this method with exception handling omitted for brevity.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
public void startup( ServletContext context ) {
    String configFile = context.getInitParameter(CONFIG_FILE);

     InputStream configFileInputStream = getClass().getResourceAsStream(configFile);
     jcrEngine = new JcrConfiguration().loadFrom(configFileInputStream).build();
     jcrEngine.start();
}
]]></programlisting>
			As you can see, the name of configuration file for the &JcrEngine; is read from the servlet context and used
			to initialize the engine. 
			Once the repository has been started, it is now ready to accept the main methods that provide the interface
			to the repository.		
		</para>			 
		<para>
  			The first method returns the set of repository names supported by this repository.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
public Set<String> getJcrRepositoryNames() {
    return new HashSet<String>(jcrEngine.getRepositoryNames());
}
]]></programlisting> 
			The ModeShape JCR repository does support multiple repositories on the same server.  Other JCR implementations
			that don't support multiple repositories are free to return a singleton set containing any string from this method.
		</para>
		<para>
			The other required method returns an open JCR &Session; for the user from the current request in a given repository
			and workspace.  The provider can use the &HttpServletRequest; to get the authentication credentials for the 
			HTTP user.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
public Session getSession( HttpServletRequest request,
                           String repositoryName,
                           String workspaceName ) throws RepositoryException {
    Repository repository = getRepository(repositoryName);

	SecurityContext context = new ServletSecurityContext(request);
	Credentials credentials = new SecurityContextCredentials(context);
    return repository.login(credentials, workspaceName);
}
]]></programlisting>
			The <code>getSession(...)</code> method is used by most of the REST server methods to access the JCR 
			repository and return results as needed.			
		</para>
		<para>
			Finally, the <code>shutdown()</code> method signals that the web context is being undeployed and the JCR
			repository should shutdown and clean up any resources that are in use.

		<title>Summary</title>
		<para>
			This chapter has described two ways to access a ModeShape JCR repository remotely through HTTP-based protocols.  In the 
			<link linkend="provided-connectors-part">next chapter</link>,
			the different repository connectors will be described so that you can start to use ModeShape to store new data, connect
			to existing data through JCR, or both.
