  <title>Compact Node Type (CND) Sequencer</title>
  <para>
  	This sequencer processes JCR Compact Node Definition (CND) files
		to extract the node definitions with their property definitions, and inserts these into the repository using JCR built-in types.
	The node structure generated by this sequencer is equivalent to the node structure used in <code>/jcr:system/jcr:nodeTypes</code>.
  </para>
  
  <para>
  	This sequencer can be added to the repository configuration like so:
<programlisting>
JcrConfiguration config = ...

config.sequencer("CND Sequencer")
      .usingClass("org.jboss.dna.sequencer.cnd.CndSequencer")
      .loadedFromClasspath()
      .setDescription("Sequences CND files to extract the node type definitions")
      .sequencingFrom("//(*.cnd[*])/jcr:content[@jcr:data]")
      .andOutputtingTo("/nodeTypes/$1");

</programlisting>  	 
  </para>
