  <title>Java Source File Sequencer</title>
    <para>
		One of the sequencers that included in ModeShape is the <emphasis role="strong">dna-sequencer-java</emphasis> subproject.
		This sequencer parses Java source code added to the repository and extracts the basic structure of the classes and enumerations 
		defined in the code.
		This structure includes: the package structures, class declarations, class and member attribute declarations,
		class and member method declarations with signature (but not implementation logic), enumerations with each enumeration literal value,
		annotations, and JavaDoc information for all of the above. 
		After extracting this information from the source code, the sequencer then writes this structure into the repository,
		where it can be further processed, analyzed, searched, navigated, or referenced.
	</para>
	<para>
		To use this sequencer, simply include the <code>dna-sequencer-java</code> JAR (plus all of the JARs that it is dependent upon)
		in your application and configure the &JcrConfiguration; to use this sequencer using something similar to:
