  <title>Introduction to JBoss DNA</title>
	<para>
		JBoss DNA is a JCR implementation that provides access to content stored in many different kinds of systems. 
		A JBoss DNA repository isn't yet another silo of isolated information, but rather it's a JCR view of the information 
		you already have in your environment: files systems, databases, other repositories, services, applications, etc.
	</para>
	<para>
		To your applications, JBoss DNA looks and behaves like a regular JCR repository.  Using the standard JCR API,
		applications can search, navigate, version, and listen for changes in the content.  But under the covers, JBoss DNA
		gets its content by federating multiple back-end systems (like databases, services, other repositories, etc.),
		allowing those systems to continue "owning" the information while ensuring the unified repository stays up-to-date
		and in sync.
	</para>
	<para>
		Of course when you start providing a unified view of all this information, you start recognizing the need to store 
		more information, including metadata about and relationships between the existing content. JBoss DNA lets you do this, too. 
		And JBoss DNA even tries to help you discover more about the information you already have, especially the information 
		wrapped up in the kinds of files often found in enterprise systems: service definitions, policy files, images, media, 
		documents, presentations, application components, reusable libraries, configuration files, application installations, 
		databases schemas, management scripts, and so on. As files are loaded into the repository, you can make JBoss DNA
		automatically sequence these files to extract from their content meaningful information that can be stored in the repository, 
		where it can then be searched, accessed, and analyzed using the JCR API.
	</para>
	<para>
		This document goes into detail about how JBoss DNA works to provide these capabilities.  It also talks in detail
		about many of the parts within JBoss DNA - what they do, how they work, and how you can extend or customize the
		behavior.  In particular, you'll learn about JBoss DNA <link linkend='connector-framework'>connectors</link>
		and <link linkend='sequencing-framework'>sequencers</link>, how you can use the implementations included in JBoss DNA,
		and how you can write your own to tailor JBoss DNA for your needs.
	</para>
	<para>
		So whether your a developer on the project, or you're trying to learn the intricate details of
		how JBoss DNA works, this document hopefully serves a good reference for developers on the project.

		<title>Use cases for JBoss DNA</title>
		<para>
			JBoss DNA repositories can be used in a variety of applications.  One of the more obvious use cases for a metadata repository
			is in provisioning and management, where it's critical to understand and keep track of the metadata for models, database, services, 
			components, applications, clusters, machines, and other systems used in an enterprise.  Governance takes that a step 
			farther, by also tracking the policies and expectations against which performance of the systems described by the repository can be verified.
			In these cases, a repository is an excellent mechanism for managing this complex and highly-varied information.
		</para>
		<para>
			But these large and complex use cases aren't the only way to use a JBoss DNA repository.  You could use an embedded JBoss DNA repository
			to manage configuration information for an application, or you could use JBoss DNA just provide a JCR interface on top of a few non-JCR systems.
		</para>
		<para>
			The point is that JBoss DNA can be used in many different ways, ranging from the very tiny embedded repository to a large and distributed
			enterprise-grade repository.  The choice is yours.
		</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="what_is_metadata">
		<title>What is metadata?</title>
		<para>
		Before we dive into more detail about JBoss DNA and metadata repositories, it's probably useful to explain what we
		mean by the term "metadata."  Simply put, <emphasis>metadata</emphasis> is the information you need to manage something.  
		For example, it's the information needed to configure an operating system, or the description of the information in an LDAP tree, 
		or the topology of your network. It's the configuration of an application server or enterprise service bus.
		It's the steps involved in validating an application before it can go into production. It's the description of your 
		database schemas, or of your services, or of the messages going in and coming out of a service. JBoss DNA is 
		designed to be a repository for all this (and more).
		</para>
		<para>
		There are a couple of important things to understand about metadata.  First, many systems manage (and frequently change) their own metadata and information.
		Databases, applications, file systems, source code management systems, services, content management systems, and even other repositories 
		are just a few types of systems that do this. We can't pull the information out and duplicate it, because
		then we risk having multiple copies that are out-of-sync.  Ideally, we could access all of this information through a homogenous API
		that also provides navigation, caching, versioning, search, and notification of changes.  That would make our lives significantly easier.
		</para>
		<para>
		What we want is <emphasis><link linkend="dna-connector-federation">federation</link></emphasis>.
		We can connect to these back-end systems to dynamically access the content and project it into a single, unified
		repository.  We can also cache it for faster access, as long as the cache can be invalidated based upon time or event.
		But we also need to maintain a clear picture of where all the bits come from, so users can be sure they're looking
		at the right information.  And we need to make it as easy as possible to write new connectors, since there are
		a lot of systems out there that have information we want to federate.
		</para>
		<para>
		The second important characteristic of the metadata is that a lot of it is represented as files, and there are
		a lot of different file formats.  These include source code, configuration files, web pages, database schemas,
		XML schemas, service definitions, policies, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, audio files, workflow
		definitions, business rules, and on and on.  And logically if files contain metadata, we want to add those files
		to our metadata repository.  The problem is, all that metadata is tied up as blobs in the repository.
		Ideally, our repository would automatically extract from those files the content that's most useful to us,
		and place that content inside the repository where it can be much more easily used, searched, related, and analyzed.
		JBoss DNA does exactly this via a process we call <emphasis><link linkend="sequencing">sequencing</link></emphasis>,
		and it's an important part of a metadata repository.
		</para>
		<para>
		The third important characteristic of metadata is that it rarely stays the same.  Different consumers of the
		information need to see different views of it.  Metadata about two similar systems is not always the same.
		The metadata often needs to be tagged or annotated with additional information.  And the things being
		described often change over time, meaning the metadata has to change, too.  As a result, the way in which
		we store and manage the metadata has to be flexible and able to adapt to our ever-changing needs, and the object model
		we use to interact with the repository must accommodate these needs.  The graph-based nature of the JCR API provides this 
		flexibility while also giving us the ability to constrain information when it needs to be constrained.
		</para>
	</sect1>
  <sect1 id="jcr_intro">
    <title>What is JCR?</title>
	  <para>There are a lot of choices for how applications can store information persistently so that it can be accessed at a
	    later time and by other processes. The challenge developers face is how to use an approach that most closely matches the
	    needs of their application. This choice becomes more important as developers choose to focus their efforts on
	    application-specific logic, delegating much of the responsibilities for persistence to libraries and frameworks.</para>
	  <para>
	    Perhaps one of the easiest techniques is to simply store information in
	    <emphasis>files</emphasis>
	    . The Java language makes working with files relatively easy, but Java really doesn't provide many bells and whistles. So
	    using files is an easy choice when the information is either not complicated (for example property files), or when users may
	    need to read or change the information outside of the application (for example log files or configuration files). But using
	    files to persist information becomes more difficult as the information becomes more complex, as the volume of it increases,
	    or if it needs to be accessed by multiple processes. For these situations, other techniques often have more benefits.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Another technique built into the Java language is
	    <emphasis>Java serialization</emphasis>
	    , which is capable of persisting the state of an object graph so that it can be read back in at a later time. However, Java
	    serialization can quickly become tricky if the classes are changed, and so it's beneficial usually when the information is
	    persisted for a very short period of time. For example, serialization is sometimes used to send an object graph from one
	    process to another.  Using serialization for longer-term storage of information is more risky.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    One of the more popular and widely-used persistence technologies is the <emphasis>relational database</emphasis>. 
			Relational database management systems have been around for decades and are very capable. The Java Database Connectivity
	    (JDBC) API provides a standard interface for connecting to and interacting with relational databases. However, it is a
	    low-level API that requires a lot of code to use correctly, and it still doesn't abstract away the DBMS-specific SQL
	    grammar. Also, working with relational data in an object-oriented language can feel somewhat unnatural, so many developers
	    map this data to classes that fit much more cleanly into their application. The problem is that manually creating this
	    mapping layer requires a lot of repetitive and non-trivial JDBC code.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Object-relational mapping</emphasis>
	    libraries automate the creation of this mapping layer and result in far less code that is much more maintainable with
	    performance that is often as good as (if not better than) handwritten JDBC code. The new
	    <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/jpa/">Java Persistence API (JPA)</ulink>
	    provide a standard mechanism for defining the mappings (through annotations) and working with these entity objects. Several
	    commercial and open-source libraries implement JPA, and some even offer additional capabilities and features that go beyond
	    JPA. For example, <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</ulink> is one of the most feature-rich JPA implementations
			and offers object caching, statement caching, extra association
	    mappings, and other features that help to improve performance and usefulness.  Plus, Hibernate is open-source (with support
			offered by <ulink url="http://www.jboss.com">JBoss</ulink>).
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    While relational databases and JPA are solutions that work well for many applications, they are more limited in cases when the
	    information structure is highly flexible, the structure is not known <emphasis>a priori</emphasis>, or that structure is
	 		subject to frequent change and customization. In these situations, <emphasis>content repositories</emphasis>
	    may offer a better choice for persistence. Content repositories are almost a hybrid with the storage capabilities of
	 		relational databases and the flexibility offered by other systems, such as using files.  Content repositories also
	    typically provide other capabilities as well, including versioning, indexing, search, access control,
	    transactions, and observation. Because of this, content repositories are used by content management systems (CMS), document
	    management systems (DMS), and other applications that manage electronic files (e.g., documents, images, multi-media, web
	    content, etc.) and metadata associated with them (e.g., author, date, status, security information, etc.). The
	    <ulink url="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">Content Repository for Java technology API</ulink>
	    provides a standard Java API for working with content repositories. Abbreviated "JCR", this API was developed as part of the
	    Java Community Process under <ulink url="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">JSR-170</ulink>
	    and is being revised under <ulink url="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283">JSR-283</ulink>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
		  The JCR API provides a number of information services that are needed by many applications,
		  including: read and write access to information; the ability to structure information in a hierarchical and flexible manner that can adapt
		  and evolve over time; ability to work with unstructured content; ability to (transparently) handle large strings; 
		  notifications of changes in the information; search and query; versioning of information; access control; integrity constraints;
		  participation within distributed transactions; explicit locking of content; and of course persistence.

						JBoss DNA project doesn't follow these closely, we do emphasize the importance of always having running software

						In reality, this BDD adopts the language of the user so that tests are written using words that are meaningful
						to users.  With recent test frameworks (like JUnit 4.4), we're able to write our unit tests to express
						the desired behavior.  For example, a test class for sequencer implementation might have a test method
						<code>shouldNotThrowAnErrorWhenStreamIsNull()</code>, which is very easy to understand the intent.
						The result appears to be a larger number of finer-grained test methods, but which are more easily understood
						and easier to write.  In fact, many advocates of BDD argue that one of the biggest challenges of TDD is knowing what
						tests to write in the beginning, whereas with BDD the shift in focus and terminology make it easier for more
						developers to enumerate the tests they need.

            <emphasis role="strong">dna-jcr</emphasis>
            contains JBoss DNA's implementation of the JCR API. If you're using JBoss DNA as a JCR repository, this is the
 						top-level dependency that you'll want to use.  The module defines all required dependencies, except for
 						the repository connector(s) and any sequencer implementations needed by your configuration.
						As we'll see later on, using JBoss DNA as a JCR repository is easy: simply create a configuration, start the JCR engine,
						get the JCR &Repository; object for your repository, and then use the JCR API.
						This module also contains the Jackrabbit JCR API unit tests that verify the behavior of the JBoss DNA implementation.
						As DNA does not fully implement the JCR 1.0.1 specification, there are a series of tests that are currently commented 
            out in this module.  The <code>dna-jcr-tck</code> module contains all of these tests.

      The following modules make up the various web application projects (and are located in the source
      under the
      <code>web/</code>
      directory):
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong">dna-web-jcr-rest</emphasis>
            provides a set of JSR-311 (JAX-RS) objects that form the basis of a RESTful server for Java Content Repositories.  This project 
            provides integration with DNA's JCR implementation (of course) but also contains a service provider interface (SPI) that can be 
            used to integrate other JCR implementations with these RESTful services in the future.  For ease of packaging, these classes are
            provided as a JAR that can be placed in the WEB-INF/lib of a deployed RESTful server WAR.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong">dna-web-jcr-rest-war</emphasis>
            wraps the RESTful services from the dna-web-jcr-rest JAR into a WAR and provides in-container integration tests.  This project
            can be consulted as a template for how to deploy the RESTful services in a custom implementation. 
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      There are also documentation modules (located in the source under the
      <code>docs/</code>
      directory):
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong">docs-getting-started</emphasis>
            is the project with the
            <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</ulink>
            source for the JBoss DNA Getting Started document.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong">docs-getting-started-examples</emphasis>
            is the project with the Java source for the example application used in the JBoss DNA Getting Started document.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong">docs-reference-guide</emphasis>
            is the project with the
            <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</ulink>
            source for this document, the JBoss DNA Reference Guide document.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Finally, there is a module that represents the whole JBoss DNA project:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong">dna</emphasis>
            is the parent project that aggregates all of the other projects and that contains some asset files to create the
            necessary Maven artifacts during a build.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Each of these modules is a Maven project with a group ID of
      <code>org.jboss.dna</code>
      . All of these projects correspond to artifacts in the
      <ulink url="&JBossMaven;">JBoss Maven 2 Repository</ulink>
      .
