		ModeShape &version; adds a lot of new features and capabilities.  It introduced an initial RESTful server that makes
		JCR repositories accessible over HTTP to clients.  The JCR implementation was enhanced to support more features,
		including the ability to define and register node types using the Compact Node Definition (CND) format.
		A new configuration system was added, making it very easy to configure and manage the ModeShape JCR engine.
		An observation framework was added to the graph API. The federation connector was rewritten to improve performance
		and correct several issues.  And quite a few issues were fixed.
	</para>
	<para>
		What's next for ModeShape?  Passing all of the JCR API compatibility tests for Level 1 and Level 2,
		plus some of the optional features, is the primary focus for the next release.  Of course, there are a handful of
		improvements we'd like to make under the covers, and a few outstanding issues that we'll address.
		Farther out on our <ulink url="&Roadmap;">roadmap</ulink> are the development of additional connectors and sequencers,
		some Eclipse tooling for publishing artifacts to a repository, and quite a few other interesting features.

    We're always looking for suggestions and contributors.  If you'd like to get involved on ModeShape, the first
		step is joining the <ulink url="&Home;lists.html">mailing lists</ulink> or hopping into our chat room
		on IRC (at irc.freenode.net#jbossdna).  You can also <ulink url="&Home;subversion.html">download the code</ulink>
		and get it building, and start looking for simple issues or bugs in our
    <ulink url="&JIRA;">JIRA issue management system</ulink>.
  </para>
