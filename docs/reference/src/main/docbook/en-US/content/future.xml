		ModeShape &versionNumber; provides a very capable JCR implementation with powerful and unique features not matched
		by other implementations.  
		Version &versionNumber; improves the JDBC driver, the JBoss AS deployment, and the RHQ monitoring
		plugin, along with numerous other fixes and improvements.
		Of course, the release also comes with quite a few <ulink url="&ReleaseNotes;">bug fixes and improvements</ulink>.

		At this point, ModeShape passes virtually all of the JCR Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) tests,
		except for a few known issues with ModeShape as well as bugs in the TCK tests. As soon as these
		are fixed, we'll start the process of attaining JCR 2.0 certification for ModeShape.
	</para>
	<para>
		What's next for ModeShape? The focus for the next release will be to focus on optimization and performance improvements.
		Other items on our longer term <ulink url="&Roadmap;">roadmap</ulink> include
		a web user interface, Seam integration, and integration with even more kinds of
		information systems and repositories.

    We're always looking for suggestions and contributors.  If you'd like to get involved on ModeShape, the first
		step is joining the <ulink url="&Home;lists.html">mailing lists</ulink> or hopping into our chat room
		on IRC (at irc.freenode.net#jbossmodeshape).  You can also <ulink url="&Home;subversion.html">download the code</ulink>
		and get it building, and start looking for simple issues or bugs in our
    <ulink url="&JIRA;">JIRA issue management system</ulink>.
