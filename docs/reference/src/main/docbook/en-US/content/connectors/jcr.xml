  <title>JCR Connector</title>
  <para>
		This connector enables ModeShape to access and store content in another separate JCR repository instance.
		With it, ModeShape can integrate with other JCR implementations and even federate multiple JCR repositories into 
    a single unified repository.
  </para>
	<note>
		<para>
			This connector is currently a technical preview, and we're seeking feedback and assistance in
    	identifying bugs and specifying the required functionality.
		</para>
  </note>
  <para>
	  The connector is designed to find the external JCR Repository instance in JNDI, though the location in JNDI
	  can be easily configured with the "repositoryJndiName" property.
	</para>
	<para>
		The connector also has several ways to
		authenticate and obtain a &Session;. First of all, if a fixed &Credentials; are set via the properties,
		then the &Session; will always be obtained using these credentials.  If a username and password are set
		via the properties (and no &Credentials; is set), then the connector will create a &SimpleCredentials;
		and use it to obtain a &Session;.  In all other cases, the connector will use the <code>login</code>
		methods on &Repository; that do not require a &Credentials;.
	</para>
	<para>
		This means that when JAAS is used by both the ModeShape repository using the JCR connector and a ModeShape
		repository accessed by the connector, the connector will obtain a &Session; to the underlying repository
		using the same &Subject; used in the incoming request.
	</para>
	<para>
		The connector automatically handles any differences in namespaces between the underlying JCR repository and
		the ModeShape system. However, at this time it is a requirement that node types used by the content in the underlying
		JCR repository must also be registered into the ModeShape repository (or repositories) using the connector.
	</para>
	<para>
		The &JcrRepositorySource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

	<para>
		One way to configure the JCR connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance with a repository source that uses the &JcrRepositorySource; class.
		For example:
	</para>
  <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = ...
config.repositorySource("Repository Source")
      .usingClass(FileSystemSource.class)
      .setDescription("The repository for our content")
      .setProperty("repositoryJndiName", "java:/myRepository")
      .setProperty("username", "jsmith")
      .setProperty("password", "secret");
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		Another way to configure the JCR connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance and load an XML configuration file that contains a repository source that 
		uses the &JcrRepositorySource; class.
		For example, here's a file named configRepository.xml that represents the same configuration as above:
	</para>
	
  <programlisting language="XML" role="XML"><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration xmlns:mode="http://www.modeshape.org/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0">
    <!-- 
    Define the sources for the content.  These sources are directly accessible using the 
    ModeShape-specific Graph API. In fact, this is how the ModeShape JCR implementation works.  You can 
    think of these as being similar to JDBC DataSource objects, except that they expose graph 
    content via the Graph API instead of records via SQL or JDBC. 
    -->
    <mode:sources jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
        <!-- 
        The 'Repository Source' repository is a JCR source.
        -->
        <mode:source jcr:name="Repository Source" 
        	mode:classname="org.modeshape.connector.jcr.JcrRepositorySource"
        	mode:description="The repository for our content"
        	mode:repositoryJndiName="java:/myRepository"
        	mode:username="jsmith"
        	mode:password="secret">
      	    <!-- 
      	    If desired, specify a cache policy that caches items in memory for 5 minutes (300000 ms).
      	    This fragment can be left out if the connector should not cache any content.
      	    -->
      	    <mode:cachePolicy jcr:name="cachePolicy" 
      	      mode:classname="org.modeshape.graph.connector.path.cache.InMemoryWorkspaceCache$InMemoryCachePolicy"
      	      mode:timeToLiveInMilliseconds="300000" />
        </mode:source>    
    </mode:sources>

	<!-- MIME type detectors and JCR repositories would be defined below --> 
</configuration>
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		The configuration can then be loaded from Java like this:
	</para>
	
	<programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = new JcrConfiguration().loadFrom("/configRepository.xml");
 ]]></programlisting>
