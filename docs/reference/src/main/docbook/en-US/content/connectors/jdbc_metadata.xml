	<title>JDBC Metadata Connector</title>
	<para>
		This connector provides read-only access to the metadata (e.g., catalogs, schemas, table structures) of a relational 
		database. The connector yields a content graph that looks like this:
		<programlisting>
/ (root node)
    + &lt;catalog name&gt; - one node for each accessible catalog in the database.
        + &lt;schema name&gt; - one node for each accessible schema in the catalog.
            + tables - a single node that is the parent of all tables in the schema.
            |   + &lt;table name&gt; - one node for each table in the schema.
            |      + &lt;column name&gt; - one node for each column in the table.
            + procedures - a single node that is the parent of all procedures in the schema.
                + &lt;procedure name&gt; - one node for each procedure in the schema.
</programlisting>		
		The root, table, column, and procedure nodes contain additional properties that correspond to the metadata provide by the
		&DatabaseMetaData; class.  In databases that do not support catalogs or schemas (or allow the empty string as a valid
		catalog or schema name, the value of the <code>defaultCatalogName</code> and/or <code>defaultSchemaName</code> properties
		will be used instead when determining the graph name.  
		<note>
			<para>
			This connector has currently been tested successfully against Oracle 10g, Oracle 11g, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 (with the Microsoft JDBC driver), 
			IBM DB2 v9, Sybase ASE 15, MySQL 5 (with the InnoDB engine), PostgreSQL 8, and HSQLDB.
			As JDBC driver implementations of the &DatabaseMetaData; interface tend to vary widely, other databases may or may not work
			with the default &MetadataCollector; implementation.  As one example, the <code>metadataCollectorClassName</code> property
			must be set to <code>org.jboss.dna.connector.meta.jdbc.SqlServerMetadataConnector</code> if the Microsoft JDBC driver is used.  This is
			to work around a known bug where that driver returns a list of users from a call to &DatabaseMetaData;.getSchemas() instead of a list of schemas.

		To use this connector with the DNA JCR layer, you must import the JCR node types that this connector uses.  These are bundled
		in the JAR for this connector at the path <code>/org/jboss/dna/connector/meta/jdbc/nodeTypes.cnd</code>.  Please see the &GettingStarted; Guide
		for detailed examples of how to import custom JCR node types.

	<para>
		The &JdbcMetadataSource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

	<para>
		The JDBC metadata connector is used by creating in the &JcrConfiguration; a repository source that uses the &JdbcMetadataSource; class.
		For example:
	</para>
  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = ...
config.repositorySource("source A")
      .usingClass(JdbcMetadataSource.class)
      .setDescription("The database store for our content")
      .setProperty("dataSourceJndiName", "java:/MyDataSource")
      .setProperty("nameOfDefaultWorkspace", "default")
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		Of course, setting other more advanced properties would entail calling <code>setProperty(...)</code> for each.  Since almost all
		of the properties have acceptable default values, however, we don't need to set very many of them.
