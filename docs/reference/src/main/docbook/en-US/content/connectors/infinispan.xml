  <title>Infinispan Connector</title>
  <para>
  	The Infinispan repository connector allows a <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/">Infinispan</ulink> instance to be 
		used as a ModeShape (and thus JCR) repository.  This provides a way for the content in a repository to be stored in an
		effective, scalable, and distributed data grid,
		and can be <link linkend="federation-connector">federated</link> with other repository sources to provide a distributed repository.
  </para>
	<para>
		The &InfinispanSource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

			<tbody>
				<row>
					<entry>cacheManagerJndiName</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the name in JNDI where an existing Infinispan Cache Manager instance can be found.
						That factory would then be used if needed to create an Infinispan Cache instance.  If no value is provided, then the
						Infinispan <code>DefaultCacheManager</code> class is used.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>cacheConfigurationName</entry>
					<entry>
						<para>Optional property that, if used, specifies the name of the configuration resource or file that is supplied to the cache manager
						when creating a new Infinispan DefaultCacheManager instance.  The configuration name is first treated as a resource name and will be attempted
						to be loaded from the &ClassLoader;.  If that is unsuccessful, the configuration name is assumed to be a file name and will be loaded
						from the file system.  This initialization happens the first time that the source is used.
						</para>
						<para><emphasis>Note that the <code>cacheManagerJndiName</code> property is checked first as a pointer to the Infinispan <code>CacheManager</code>.
							If the JNDI name points to a CacheManager, the <code>cacheConfigurationName</code> property will not be considered. 
						</emphasis></para>
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>defaultCachePolicy</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the default for how long this information provided by this source may to be 
						cached by other, higher-level components.  The default value of null implies that this source does not define a specific
						duration for caching information provided by this repository source.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>defaultWorkspaceName</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that is initialized to an empty string and which defines the name for the workspace that will be used by default
						if none is specified.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>name</entry>
					<entry>The name of the repository source, which is used by the &RepositoryService; when obtaining a &RepositoryConnection; by name.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>predefinedWorkspaceNames</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that defines the names of the workspaces that exist and that are available for use without having to create them.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>retryLimit</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the number of times that any single operation on a &RepositoryConnection; to this source should be retried
						following a communication failure. The default value is '0'.</entry>
				</row>	
				<row>
					<entry>rootNodeUuid</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the UUID that should be used for the root node of each workspace.  If no value is
					specified, a random UUID is generated each time that the repository is started.</entry>
				</row>	
				<row>
					<entry>updatesAllowed</entry>
					<entry>Determines whether the content in the connector is can be updated ("true"), or if the content may only be read ("false").

 	<para>
		One way to configure the Infinispan connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance with a repository source that uses the &InfinispanSource; class.
		For example:
	</para>
  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = ...
config.repositorySource("Infinispan Store")
      .usingClass(InfinispanSource.class)
      .setDescription("The repository for our content")
      .setProperty("defaultWorkspaceName", "prod")
      .setProperty("rootNodeUuid", UUID.fromString("84b73fc8-81a8-42ed-aa4b-3905094966f0")
      .setProperty("predefinedWorkspaceNames", new String[] { "staging", "dev"});
]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		Another way to configure the Infinispan connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance and load an XML configuration file that contains a repository source that 
		uses the &InfinispanSource; class.
		For example a file named configRepository.xml can be created with these contents:
	</para>
	
  <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration xmlns:mode="http://www.modeshape.org/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0">
    <!-- 
    Define the sources for the content.  These sources are directly accessible using the 
    ModeShape-specific Graph API.  In fact, this is how the ModeShape JCR implementation works.  You 
    can think of these as being similar to JDBC DataSource objects, except that they expose 
    graph content via the Graph API instead of records via SQL or JDBC. 
    -->
    <mode:sources jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
        <!-- 
        The 'Infinispan Store' repository is a Infinispan repository with a single default 
        workspace (though others could be created, too).
        -->
        <mode:source jcr:name="Infinispan Store" 
                    mode:classname="org.modeshape.connector.infinispan.InfinispanSource" 
                    mode:description="The repository for our content"
                    mode:defaultworkspaceName="prod"
                    mode:rootNodeUuid="84b73fc8-81a8-42ed-aa4b-3905094966f0"
                    mode:predefinedWorkspaceNames="staging,dev"/>    
    </mode:sources>
    
	<!-- MIME type detectors and JCR repositories would be defined below --> 
</configuration>
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		The configuration can then be loaded from Java like this:
	</para>
	
	<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = new JcrConfiguration().loadFrom("/configRepository.xml");
 ]]></programlisting>
