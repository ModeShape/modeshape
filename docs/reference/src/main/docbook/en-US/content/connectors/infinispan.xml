  <title>Infinispan Connector</title>
  <para>
  	The Infinispan repository connector allows a <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/">Infinispan</ulink> instance to be 
		used as a ModeShape (and thus JCR) repository.  This provides a way for the content in a repository to be stored in an
		effective, scalable, and distributed data grid,
		and can be <link linkend="federation-connector">federated</link> with other repository sources to provide a distributed repository.
  </para>
  <para>
	  There are two connectors that can be used. The &InfinispanSource; class, which was introduced in ModeShape 1.x, stores the content
	  in an Infinispan data grid that is running, at least in part, within the same process. The &RemoteInfinispanSource; class,
	  which was introduced in ModeShape 2.3.0.Final, is capable of storing content in a remote Infinispan data grid (where Infinispan
	  is running in remote processes). Because these two connectors communicate with Infinispan in different ways, they are configured
	  differently.
  </para>
	<para>
		The &InfinispanSource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

 	<para>
		One way to configure the Infinispan connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance with a repository source that uses the &InfinispanSource; class.
		For example:
	</para>
  <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = ...
config.repositorySource("Infinispan Store")
      .usingClass(InfinispanSource.class)
      .setDescription("The repository for our content")
      .setProperty("defaultWorkspaceName", "prod")
      .setProperty("predefinedWorkspaceNames", new String[] { "staging", "dev"});
]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		Another way to configure the Infinispan connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance and load an XML configuration file that contains a repository source that 
		uses the &InfinispanSource; class.
		For example a file named configRepository.xml can be created with these contents:
	</para>
	
  <programlisting language="XML" role="XML"><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration xmlns:mode="http://www.modeshape.org/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0">
    <!-- 
    Define the sources for the content.  These sources are directly accessible using the 
    ModeShape-specific Graph API.  In fact, this is how the ModeShape JCR implementation works.  You 
    can think of these as being similar to JDBC DataSource objects, except that they expose 
    graph content via the Graph API instead of records via SQL or JDBC. 
    -->
    <mode:sources jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
        <!-- 
        The 'Infinispan Store' repository is a Infinispan repository with a single default 
        workspace (though others could be created, too).
        -->
        <mode:source jcr:name="Infinispan Store" 
                    mode:classname="org.modeshape.connector.infinispan.InfinispanSource" 
                    mode:description="The repository for our content"
                    mode:defaultworkspaceName="prod">
           <mode:predefinedWorkspaceNames>staging</mode:predefinedWorkspaceNames>
           <mode:predefinedWorkspaceNames>dev</mode:predefinedWorkspaceNames>
        </mode:source>
    </mode:sources>
    
	<!-- MIME type detectors and JCR repositories would be defined below --> 
</configuration>
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		The configuration can then be loaded from Java like this:
	</para>
	
	<programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = new JcrConfiguration().loadFrom("/configRepository.xml");
 ]]></programlisting>
 	<sect1>
 		<title>Considerations for Distributed Sources</title>
 		<para>
		The &InfinispanSource; can be used to provide access to an Infinispan cluster, but be sure to use the DIST_SYNC
		cache mode.  Using other modes will likely lead to data inconsistency.  The &RemoteInfinispanSource; can be used to connect
		to an Infinispan HotRod cache server.
 		</para>
 		<para>
 		Additionally, some operating systems (e.g., OS X) require you to set either the <code>java.net.preferIPv4Stack</code>
 		or the <code>java.net.preferIPv6Addresses</code> system property to <code>true</code>.  These properties are used by
 		JGroups, the communications library that underlies Infinispan, to help determine which address type to use.
 		</para>
 		<note>
	 		<para>The <code>rootNodeUuid</code> property <emphasis>must</emphasis> be set to the same value for all Infinispan sources in the cluster.</para>
 		</note>
 	</sect1>
	<sect2>
		<title>Considerations for using the HotRod Server</title>
		<para>
		The Infinispan HotRod Server must be made aware of the ModeShape classes that will be stored in it, since it will be running
		in a separate JVM.  The following jar files should be added to the classpath of the HotRod Server:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>modeshape-common</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>modeshape-graph</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>modeshape-connector-infinispan</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>google-collections</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>joda-time</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    Only these libraries contain the classes that are used to store content within Infinispan.
