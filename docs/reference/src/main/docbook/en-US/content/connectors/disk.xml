  <title>Disk Connector</title>
  <para>
		This connector stores content in a ModeShape-specific file format on disk.  Although this may seem similar in concept to the <link linkend="file-system-connector">File System Connector</link>,
		this connector actually serves a much different purpose.  While the File System Connector is designed to expose existing files and folders on the 
		disk and allow ModeShape users to create content that can be read directly by other applications, the Disk Connector is designed for efficiency and
		stores content in a serialized representation that is not readily accessible to other applications.  Conversely, the Disk Connector supports referenceable
		nodes and can efficiently access nodes by UUID, unlike the File System Connector.    
 	</para>
	<para>
		The &DiskSource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

		  		<entry>Property</entry>
		  		<entry>Description</entry>
				</row>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<row>
					<entry>cachePolicy</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the cache policy for this repository source.  When not used, this source will not define a specific
						duration for caching information.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>creatingWorkspaceAllowed</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that defines whether clients can create additional workspaces.  The default value is "true".
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>defaultWorkspaceName</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that is initialized to <code>"default"</code> and which defines the name for the workspace that will be used by default
						if none is specified.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>largeValuePath</entry>
					<entry>Optional, advanced property that, if specified, specifies the path to the large value area.  <emphasis>This path is relative to the value of the <code>repositoryRootPath</code> property.</emphasis>
						The default value for this property is <code>"largeValues"</code> and there is no need to change it, even if there may be a workspace named <code>"largeValues"</code>. 
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>largeValueSizeInBytes</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if specified, sets the threshold for large values.  Binary property values that exceed this size will be copied into the large
					value area for this repository, where they can be shared between nodes and lazily loaded to improve node retrieval time.  The default value is "8192".
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>name</entry>
					<entry>The name of the repository source, which is used by the &RepositoryService; when obtaining a &RepositoryConnection; by name.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>predefinedWorkspaceNames</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines names of the workspaces that are predefined and need not be created before being used.
						This can be coupled with a "false" value for the "creatingWorkspaceAllowed" property to allow only the use of only predefined workspaces.
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>rootNodeUuid</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the UUID that should be used for the root node of each workspace.  If no value is
					specified, a default UUID is used.</entry>
				</row>	
				<row>
					<entry>retryLimit</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the number of times that any single operation on a &RepositoryConnection; to this source should be retried
						following a communication failure. The default value is '0'.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>updatesAllowed</entry>
					<entry>Determines whether the content in the file system can be updated ("true"), or if the content may only be read ("false").
						The default value is "true".</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>repositoryRootPath</entry>
					<entry>
					<para>Optional property that specifies a path on the local file system to the root of all workspaces.  The connector will use this as the root
					for a file and folder structure for storing content.  The default value is "/tmp", so setting this property to a more logical value is strongly 
					recommended.

	<para>
		One way to configure the file system connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance with a repository source that uses the &DiskSource; class.
		For example:
	</para>
  <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = ...
config.repositorySource("Disk Store")
      .usingClass(DiskSource.class)
      .setDescription("The repository for our content")
      .setProperty("repositoryRootPath", "/home/content/someApp")
      .setProperty("defaultWorkspaceName", "prod")
      .setProperty("predefinedWorkspaceNames", new String[] { "staging", "dev"})
      .setProperty("rootNodeUuid", UUID.fromString("fd129c12-81a8-42ed-aa4b-820dba49e6f0")
      .setProperty("updatesAllowed", "true")
      .setProperty("creatingWorkspaceAllowed", "false");
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		Another way to configure the file system connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance and load an XML configuration file that contains a repository source that 
		uses the &DiskSource; class.
		For example a file named configRepository.xml can be created with these contents:
	</para>
	
  <programlisting language="XML" role="XML"><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration xmlns:mode="http://www.modeshape.org/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0">
    <!-- 
    Define the sources for the content.  These sources are directly accessible using the 
    ModeShape-specific Graph API. In fact, this is how the ModeShape JCR implementation works.  You can 
    think of these as being similar to JDBC DataSource objects, except that they expose graph 
    content via the Graph API instead of records via SQL or JDBC. 
    -->
    <mode:sources jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
        <!-- 
        The 'Disk Store' repository is a disk source with a three predefined workspaces 
        ("prod", "staging", and "dev").
        -->
        <mode:source jcr:name="Disk Store" 
        	mode:classname="org.modeshape.connector.disk.DiskSource"
        	mode:description="The repository for our content"
        	mode:repositoryRootPath="/home/content/someApp"
        	mode:defaultWorkspaceName="prod"
        	mode:creatingWorkspacesAllowed="false"
        	mode:rootNodeUuid="fd129c12-81a8-42ed-aa4b-820dba49e6f0"
        	mode:updatesAllowed="true" >
            <mode:predefinedWorkspaceNames>staging</mode:predefinedWorkspaceNames>
            <mode:predefinedWorkspaceNames>dev</mode:predefinedWorkspaceNames>
        </mode:source>    
    </mode:sources>

	<!-- MIME type detectors and JCR repositories would be defined below --> 
</configuration>
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		The configuration can then be loaded from Java like this:
	</para>
	
	<programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = new JcrConfiguration().loadFrom("/configRepository.xml");
 ]]></programlisting>
