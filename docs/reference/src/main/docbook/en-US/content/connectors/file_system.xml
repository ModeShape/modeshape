  <title>File System Connector</title>
  <para>
		This connector exposes an area of the local file system as a graph of "nt:file" and "nt:folder" nodes. 
		The connector can be configured so that the workspace name is either a path to the directory on the file system that represents the root of that
		workspace <emphasis>or</emphasis> the name of subdirectory within a root directory (see the <code>workspaceRootPath</code> property below). Each 
		connector can define whether it allows new workspaces to be created, but if so the names of the new workspaces
		must represent valid paths to existing directories.
		<note>
			<para>
			The file nodes returned by this connector will have a primary type of <code>nt:file</code> and a child node named <code>jcr:content</code>.
			The <code>jcr:content</code> node will have a primary type of <code>dna:resource</code>.  The <code>dna:resource</code> node type is equivalent
			to the built-in <code>nt:resource</code> node type in all ways except one: it does not extend <code>mix:referenceable</code>.  This is because
			DNA cannot assign a persistent UUID to the files in the file system or guarantee that no other process will move or delete the files outside of DNA.
			The <code>mix:referenceable</code> node type cannot be implemented if either of these conditions cannot be met.   

			Additional properties (including mixin types) can be added by setting the <code>customPropertiesFactory</code> property to point to an implementation of 
			the &CustomPropertiesFactory; interface.

		The &FileSystemSource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

			<tbody>
				<row>
					<entry>cachePolicy</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the cache policy for this repository source.  When not used, this source will not define a specific
						duration for caching information.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>creatingWorkspaceAllowed</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that defines whether clients can create additional workspaces.  The default value is "true".
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>defaultWorkspaceName</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that is initialized to <code>"default"</code> and which defines the name for the workspace that will be used by default
						if none is specified.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>name</entry>
					<entry>The name of the repository source, which is used by the &RepositoryService; when obtaining a &RepositoryConnection; by name.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>predefinedWorkspaceNames</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines names of the workspaces that are predefined and need not be created before being used.
						This can be coupled with a "false" value for the "creatingWorkspaceAllowed" property to allow only the use of only predefined workspaces.
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>retryLimit</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the number of times that any single operation on a &RepositoryConnection; to this source should be retried
						following a communication failure. The default value is '0'.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>rootNodeUuid</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the UUID that should be used for the root node of each workspace.  If no value is
					specified, a default UUID is used.</entry>
				</row>	
				<row>
					<entry>updatesAllowed</entry>
					<entry>Determines whether the content in the file system can be updated ("true"), or if the content may only be read ("false").
						The default value is "false" to avoid unintentional security vulnerabilities.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>workspaceRootPath</entry>
					<entry>
					<para>Optional property that, if used, specifies a path on the local file system to the root of all workspaces.  The source will will 
					use the name of the workspace as a relative path from the <code>workspaceRootPath</code> to determine the path for a particular workspace.  
					If no value (or a <code>null</code> value) is specified, the source will use the name of the workspace as a relative path from the current working 
					directory of this virtual machine (as defined by <code>new File(".")</code>.
					</para>
					<para>As an example for a workspace named <code>"default/foo"</code>,
					the source will use <code>new File(workspaceRootPath, "default/foo")</code> as the source directory for the connector if <code>workspaceRootPath</code> is set
					to a non-null value, or <code>new File(".", "default/foo")</code> as the source directory for the connector if <code>workspaceRootPath</code> is
					set to <code>null</code>.

	<para>
		One way to configure the file system connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance with a repository source that uses the &FileSystemSource; class.
		For example:
	</para>
  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = ...
config.repositorySource("FS Store")
      .usingClass(FileSystemSource.class)
      .setDescription("The repository for our content")
      .setProperty("workspaceRootPath", "/home/content/someApp")
      .setProperty("defaultWorkspaceName", "prod")
      .setProperty("predefinedWorkspaceNames", new String[] { "staging", "dev"})
      .setProperty("rootNodeUuid", UUID.fromString("fd129c12-81a8-42ed-aa4b-820dba49e6f0")
      .setProperty("updatesAllowed", "true")
      .setProperty("creatingWorkspaceAllowed", "false");
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		Another way to configure the file system connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance and load an XML configuration file that contains a repository source that 
		uses the &FileSystemSource; class.
		For example a file named configRepository.xml can be created with these contents:
	</para>
	
  <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration xmlns:dna="http://www.jboss.org/dna/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0">
    <!-- 
    Define the sources for the content.  These sources are directly accessible using the 
    DNA-specific Graph API. In fact, this is how the DNA JCR implementation works.  You can 
    think of these as being similar to JDBC DataSource objects, except that they expose graph 
    content via the Graph API instead of records via SQL or JDBC. 
    -->
    <dna:sources jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
        <!-- 
        The 'FS Store' repository is a file system source with a three predefined workspaces 
        ("prod", "staging", and "dev").
        -->
        <dna:source jcr:name="FS Store" 
        	dna:classname="org.jboss.dna.connector.filesystem.FileSystemSource"
        	dna:description="The repository for our content"
        	dna:workspaceRootPath="/home/content/someApp"
        	dna:defaultWorkspaceName="prod"
        	dna:predefinedWorkspaceNames="staging, dev"
        	dna:rootNodeUuid="fd129c12-81a8-42ed-aa4b-820dba49e6f0"
        	dna:creatingWorkspacesAllowed="false"
        	dna:updatesAllowed="true"
        	/>    
    </dna:sources>

	<!-- MIME type detectors and JCR repositories would be defined below --> 
</configuration>
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		The configuration can then be loaded from Java like this:
	</para>
	
	<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = new JcrConfiguration().loadFrom("/configRepository.xml");
 ]]></programlisting>
