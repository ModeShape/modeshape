  <title>File System Connector</title>
  <para>
		This connector exposes an area of the local file system as a <emphasis>read-only</emphasis> graph of "nt:file" and "nt:folder" nodes. 
		The connector considers a workspace name to be the path to the directory on the file system that represents the root of that
		workspace. Each connector can define whether it allows new workspaces can be created, but if so the names of the new workspaces
		must represent valid paths to existing directories.
  </para>
	<para>
		The &FileSystemSource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

					<entry>directoryForDefaultWorkspace</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the file system path to the existing directory that should be used for the 
						default workspace. If null (or not specified), the source will use the current working directory of this virtual machine
						(as defined by <code>new File(".").getAbsolutePath()</code>.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>predefinedWorkspaceNames</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines names of the workspaces that are predefined and need not be created before being used.
						This can be coupled with a "fase" value for the "creatingWorkspaceAllowed" property to allow only the use of only predefined workspaces.

					<entry>creatingWorkspaceAllowed</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that defines whether clients can create additional workspaces.  The default value is "true".

					<entry>retryLimit</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the number of times that any single operation on a &RepositoryConnection; to this source should be retried
						following a communication failure. The default value is '0'.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>cacheTimeToLiveInMilliseconds</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the maximum time in milliseconds that any information returned by this connector

						duration for caching information.</entry>

	<para>
		Using the file system connector is used by creating in the &JcrConfiguration; a repository source that uses the &InMemoryRepositorySource; class.
		For example:

  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = ...
config.repositorySource("source A")
      .usingClass(FileSystemSource.class)
      .setDescription("The repository for our content")
      .setProperty("directoryForDefaultWorkspace", "file://some/file/path")
      .setProperty("creatingWorkspaceAllowed", "false");
