  <title>File System Connector</title>
  <para>
		This connector exposes an area of the local file system as a graph of "nt:file" and "nt:folder" nodes. 
		The connector can be configured so that the workspace name is either a path to the directory on the file system that represents the root of that
		workspace <emphasis>or</emphasis> the name of subdirectory within a root directory (see the <code>workspaceRootPath</code> property below). Each 
		connector can define whether it allows new workspaces to be created.  <emphasis>If the directory for a workspace does not exist, this connector
		will attempt to create the directory (and any missing parent directories).</emphasis>
	</para>
	<para>
		By default, this connector is not capable of storing extra properties other than those defined on the <code>nt:file</code>, <code>nt:folder</code>
		and <code>nt:resource</code> node types. This is because such properties cannot be represented natively on the file system. 
		When the connector is asked to store such properties, the default behavior is to log warnings and then to ignore these extra properties.
		Obviously this is probably not sufficient for production (unless only the standard properties are to be used). To explicitly turn on this
		behavior, set the "extraPropertiesBehavior" to "log".
	</para>
	<para>
		However, the connector can be configured differently. If the "extraPropertiesBehavior" is set to "ignore", then these extra properties will
		simply be silently ignored and lost: none will be stored, none will be loaded, and no warnings will be logged. If the "extraPropertiesBehavior"
		is set to "error", the connector will throw an exception if any extra properties are used.
	</para>
	<para>
		Perhaps the best setting for general use, however, is to set the "extraPropertiesBehavior" to "store". In this mode, any extra properties
		are written to files on the file system that are adjacent to the actual file or folder. For example, given a "nt:folder" node that represents
		the "folder1" directory, all extra properties will be stored in a text file named "folder1.modeshape" in the same parent 
		directory as the "folder1" directory.  Similarly, given a "nt:file" node that represents the "file1" file on the file system, all
		extra properties will be stored in a text file named "file1.modeshape" located next to the "file1" file. Note that the "nt:resource" node for
		our "nt:file" node also is stored in the same location, so we can't use the "file1.modeshape" file (it's already used for the "nt:file" node),
		so the connector uses the "file1.content.modeshape" file instead.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			The "store" behavior may result in the creation of many "*.modeshape" files, and because of this the "store" behavior is not the default.
		</para>
	</note>
	<para>
		The &FileSystemSource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

					<entry>customPropertiesFactory</entry>
					<entry>
						Specifies the &CustomPropertiesFactory; implementation that should be used to augment the default properties 
						available on each node.  This property can be set either from an object that implements the &CustomPropertiesFactory;
						interface or from the name of a class with a public, no-argument constructor that implements the &CustomPropertiesFactory;

					<entry>extraPropertiesBehavior</entry>
					<entry>
						Optional setting that specifies how to handle the extra properties on "nt:file", "nt:folder", and "nt:resource" nodes that
						cannot be represented on the native files themselves. Set this to "log" if warnings are to be sent to the log 
						(the default), or "error" if setting such properties should cause an error, or "store" if they should be stored in ancillary 
						files next to the files and folders, or "ignore" if they should be silently ignored. The "log" value will be used by default 
						or an invalid value is specified. This setting will be ignored if a "customPropertiesFactory" class name is specified.

						if none is specified.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>exclusionPattern</entry>
					<entry>
						<para>
						Specifies a regular expression that is used to determine which files and folders in the underlying file system should be exposed through

						Setting this property to <code>null</code> has the effect of removing the exclusion pattern.

					<entry>
						<para>
						Specifies a regular expression that is used to determine which files and folders in the underlying file system should be exposed through

						<para>
						This property can be set either from an object that implements the &FilenameFilter;

					<para>Optional property that, if used, specifies a path on the local file system to the root of all workspaces.  The source will will 
					use the name of the workspace as a relative path from the <code>workspaceRootPath</code> to determine the path for a particular workspace.  
					If no value (or a <code>null</code> value) is specified, the source will use the name of the workspace as a relative path from the current working 
					directory of this virtual machine (as defined by <code>new File(".")</code>.

					the source will use <code>new File(workspaceRootPath, "default/foo")</code> as the source directory for the connector if <code>workspaceRootPath</code> is set

	<para>
		One way to configure the file system connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance with a repository source that uses the &FileSystemSource; class.
		For example:
	</para>
  <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = ...
config.repositorySource("FS Store")
      .usingClass(FileSystemSource.class)
      .setDescription("The repository for our content")
      .setProperty("workspaceRootPath", "/home/content/someApp")
      .setProperty("defaultWorkspaceName", "prod")
      .setProperty("predefinedWorkspaceNames", new String[] { "staging", "dev"})
      .setProperty("rootNodeUuid", UUID.fromString("fd129c12-81a8-42ed-aa4b-820dba49e6f0")
      .setProperty("updatesAllowed", "true")
      .setProperty("creatingWorkspaceAllowed", "false");
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		Another way to configure the file system connector is to create &JcrConfiguration; instance and load an XML configuration file that contains a repository source that 
		uses the &FileSystemSource; class.
		For example a file named configRepository.xml can be created with these contents:
	</para>
	
  <programlisting language="XML" role="XML"><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration xmlns:mode="http://www.modeshape.org/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0">
    <!-- 
    Define the sources for the content.  These sources are directly accessible using the 
    ModeShape-specific Graph API. In fact, this is how the ModeShape JCR implementation works.  You can 
    think of these as being similar to JDBC DataSource objects, except that they expose graph 
    content via the Graph API instead of records via SQL or JDBC. 
    -->
    <mode:sources jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
        <!--

        	mode:defaultWorkspaceName="prod"
        	mode:creatingWorkspacesAllowed="false"

      	    <!-- 
      	    If desired, specify a cache policy that caches items in memory for 5 minutes (300000 ms).
      	    This fragment can be left out if the connector should not cache any content.
      	    -->
      	    <mode:cachePolicy jcr:name="cachePolicy"

    </mode:sources>

	<!-- MIME type detectors and JCR repositories would be defined below --> 
</configuration>
 ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		The configuration can then be loaded from Java like this:
	</para>
	
	<programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
JcrConfiguration config = new JcrConfiguration().loadFrom("/configRepository.xml");
 ]]></programlisting>
