	<title>Wrapping Up</title>
	<para>
		This document provided a very high-level overview of JBoss DNA, introducing you to what would be required to use JBoss DNA
		in your own application.  We saw two simple examples that showed two different aspects of JBoss DNA: the sequencing system
		and the connector system.  Each of these examples showed how to create a JBoss DNA configuration, how to start up
		the JBoss DNA engine, and how to then access a <code>javax.jcr.Repository</code> instance, and after that your application
		just uses the standard JCR API.
	</para>
	<para>
		For a more in-depth description of JBoss DNA and the internal workings, see our &ReferenceGuide;.
		This also describes how to write your own custom sequencers or connectors.
    If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact JBoss DNA's

    or use the
    <ulink url="http://www.jboss.com/index.html?module=bb&amp;op=viewforum&amp;f=272">user forums</ulink>
    or (preferably) the

    . If there's something in particular you're interested in, talk with the community - there may be others interested in the
    same thing.

		<para>
			What's next for JBoss DNA?  Well, the sequencing system is just the beginning.  With this release, the sequencing system
		  is stable enough so that more <link linkend="sequencers">sequencers</link> can be developed and used within your own applications.
			We've also established the foundation for JBoss DNA repositories, including a number of <link linkend="repository-connectors">connectors</link>.
			We'll continue to expand our library of sequencers and connectors, as well as expand our support of JCR.
			Other components on our roadmap include a web user interface, a REST-ful server, and a view system that allows domain-specific
			views of information in the repository.  These components are farther out on our roadmap, and at this time have not been
			targeted to a particular release.
