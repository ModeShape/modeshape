	<title>Wrapping Up</title>
	<para>
		This document provides a very high-level overview of ModeShape, introducing you to some basic concepts 
		and showing what would be required to use ModeShape in your own application.  
		We saw two simple examples that showed two different aspects of ModeShape: the sequencing system
		and the connector system.  Each of these examples showed how to create a ModeShape configuration, how to start up
		the ModeShape engine, and how to then access a <code>javax.jcr.Repository</code> instance, and after that your application
		just uses the standard JCR API.
	</para>
	<para>
		For a more in-depth description of ModeShape and the internal workings, see our &ReferenceGuide;.
		This also describes how to write your own custom sequencers or connectors.
    If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact ModeShape's
    <ulink url="mailto:dna-users@jboss.org">user mailing list</ulink>, use our
    <ulink url="http://community.jboss.org/community/dna">discussion forums</ulink>,
    or chat with the developers in the <ulink url="http://www.modeshape.org/chat.html">IRC chat room</ulink>.
    If you find a bug or have a suggestion, please let us know or (better yet) create a new issue in the project's
    <ulink url="http://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ModeShape">JIRA issue management system</ulink>
    . If there's something in particular you're interested in, talk with the community - there may be others interested in the
    same thing.

		<title>Future directions</title>
		<para>
			What's next for ModeShape?  We're very close to passing all of the JCR Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) Level 1, Level 2
			tests, plus the tests for the optional features including observation and locking.  (In fact, there are just a few outstanding
			bugs that are preventing us from passing all of these test and becoming fully JCR compliant.)  We will soon be implementing
			versioning, which is the last optional feature of JCR. 
			We will also be adding support for clustering multiple ModeShape engines spread across multiple JVM processes.
			And each release we continue to introduce more
			<link linkend="repository-connectors">connectors</link> and <link linkend="sequencers">sequencers</link> to our library.
			Other items on our long-term roadmap include a web user interface, Seam integration, and integration with even more kinds of
			information systems and repositories.
