<chapter id="downloading_and_running">
	<title>Running the example applications</title>
	<para>
    This chapter provides instructions for downloading and running a sample application that demonstrates how JBoss DNA works
    with a JCR repository to automatically sequence changing content to extract useful information. So read on to get the simple
    application running.
  </para>
	<para>JBoss DNA uses Maven 2 for its build system, as is this example. Using Maven 2 has several advantages, including
    the ability to manage dependencies. If a library is needed, Maven automatically finds and downloads that library, plus
    everything that library needs. This means that it's very easy to build the examples - or even create a maven project that
    depends on the JBoss DNA JARs.</para>
	<note>
		<para>
      To use Maven with JBoss DNA, you'll need to have <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp">JDK 5 or 6</ulink>
      and Maven 2.0.9 (or higher).</para>
		<para>
      Maven can be downloaded from <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/">http://maven.apache.org/</ulink>, and is installed by unzipping the
      <code>maven-2.0.9-bin.zip</code> file to a convenient location on your local disk. Simply add <code>$MAVEN_HOME/bin</code>
      to your path and add the following profile to your <code>~/.m2/settings.xml</code> file:</para>

		<para>This profile informs Maven of the two JBoss repositories (snapshots and releases) that contain

		<para>
			There are essentially three Maven projects: a <code>sequencers</code> project, a <code>repository</code> project, 
		  and a parent project.  All of the source for the sequencing example is located in the <code>sequencers</code> subdirectory,
		  while all of the source for the repository example is located in the <code>repository</code> subdirectory.
		</para>
		<para>
			And you may have noticed that none of the JBoss DNA libraries are there.  This is where Maven comes in.  
			The two <code>pom.xml</code> files tell Maven everything it needs to know about what libraries are required and 
			how to build the example.
		</para>
		<para>
			In a terminal, go to the <code>examples</code> directory and run:
		</para>
		<programlisting>$ mvn install</programlisting>
		<para>  
      This command downloads all of the JARs necessary to compile and build the example, including the JBoss DNA libraries,
      the libraries they depend on, and any missing Maven components.  (These are downloaded from the JBoss repositories
      only once and saved on your machine.  This means that the next time you run Maven, all the libraries will
      already be available locally, and the build will run much faster.)  The command then continues by compiling the example's source
      code (and unit tests) and running the unit tests.  The build is successful if you see the following:

		<para>If you've successfully built the examples, there will be a new <code>examples/sequencers/target/</code> directory that contains

					<para><emphasis role="strong"><code>lib</code></emphasis> subdirectory contains the JARs for all of the JBoss DNA artifacts

					  but almost all of them are from the JPA connector (which depends upon Hibernate), HSQLDB, Lucene, and the JAAS implementation.
