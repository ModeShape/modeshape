/**
 * A base class for ModeShape integration tests that set up a new ModeShape engine for each unit test.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways to run tests with this class:
 * <ol>
 * <li>All tests runs against a fresh repository created from the same configuration. In this case, the
 * {@link #startRepositoryAutomatically} variable should be set to true, and the
 * {@link #createRepositoryConfiguration(String, CacheContainer)} should be overridden if a non-default configuration is to be
 * used for all the tests.</li>
 * <li>Each test requires a fresh repository with a different configuration. In this case, the
 * {@link #startRepositoryAutomatically} variable should be set to <code>false</code>, and each test should then call one of the
 * {@link #startRepositoryWithConfiguration(RepositoryConfiguration)} methods before using the repository.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Classes can define a custom unit test {@link Before startup method}, but should always first call the {@link #beforeEach()
 * super.beforeEach()} method. Similarly, a custom unit test teardown method can be defined, but should always first call the
 * {@link #afterEach() super.afterEach()} method.
 * </p>
