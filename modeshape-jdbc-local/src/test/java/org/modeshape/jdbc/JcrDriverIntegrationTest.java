/**
 * This is a test suite that operates against a complete JcrRepository instance created and managed using the
 * {@link ModeShapeEngine}. Essentially this is an integration test, but it does test lower-level functionality of the
 * implementation of the JCR interfaces related to querying. (It is simply more difficult to unit test these implementations
 * because of the difficulty in mocking the many other components to replicate the same functionality.)
 * <p>
 * Also, because queries are read-only, the engine is set up once and used for the entire set of test methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following are the SQL semantics that the tests will be covering:
 * <li>variations of simple SELECT * FROM</li>
 * <li>JOIN
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To create the expected results to be used to run a test, use the test and print method: example:
 * DriverTestUtil.executeTestAndPrint(this.connection, "SELECT * FROM [nt:base]"); This will print the expected results like this:
 * String[] expected = { "jcr:primaryType[STRING]", "mode:root", "car:Car", "car:Car", "nt:unstructured" } Now copy the expected
 * results to the test method. Then change the test to run the executeTest method passing in the <code>expected</code> results:
 * example: DriverTestUtil.executeTest(this.connection, "SELECT * FROM [nt:base]", expected);
 * </p>
