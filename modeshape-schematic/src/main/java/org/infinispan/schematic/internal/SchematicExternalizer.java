/**
 * An abstract base class for all Schematic {@link org.infinispan.marshall.Externalizer Externalizer} implementations.
 * <p>
 * There are two primary advantages of implementing {@link AdvancedExternalizer} versus implementing
 * {@link org.infinispan.marshall.Externalizer}:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The class to be externalized must be modified with a {@code @SerializeWith} annotation. Since {@link SchematicEntryLiteral}
 * is our class, this is possible.</li>
 * <li>The generated payloads (shipped between Infinispan processes) are slightly smaller, since it includes only the
 * {@link AdvancedExternalizer}'s {@link #getId() identifier} instead of the class information and/or the serialized
 * {@link org.infinispan.marshall.Externalizer}. But for this to work, the advanced externalizers need to be registered with the
 * cache container at startup.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Unfortunately, Infinispan in AS7.1 does not allow defining {@link AdvancedExternalizer} classes for the cache container, and
 * thus they cannot be used (see <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MODE-1524">MODE-1524</a> for details). Therefore, we
 * have to rely only upon implementing {@link org.infinispan.marshall.Externalizer}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This abstract class was created so that the Schematic externalizers can easily extend it, but so that we can encapsulate in
 * this abstract class the use of {@link Externalizer} or {@link AdvancedExternalizer}. Once Infinispan in AS7 supports
 * user-defined advanced externalizers, then we can simply change this class to implement {@link AdvancedExternalizer} rather than
 * {@link Externalizer}.
 * 
 * @param <T> the type of class
