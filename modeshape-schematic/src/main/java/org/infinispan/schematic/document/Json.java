/**
 * A utility class for working with JSON documents. This class is able to read and write JSON documents that are in a special
 * modified format. <h3>Modified Format</h3> Any JSON document written in this modified format is still a valid JSON document.
 * However, certain value types supported by BSON are written as nested objects in particular patterns. In fact, it is nearly
 * identical to the JSON serialization used by MongoDB. All standard JSON values are written as expected, but the types unique to
 * BSON are written as follows:
