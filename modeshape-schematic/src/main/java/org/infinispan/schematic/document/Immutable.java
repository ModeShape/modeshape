 * This annotation documents that instances of the annotated class are immutable. This means that its state is seen to others as
 * never being changed, even though the actual private internal state may indeed change. Therefore, in an immutable class:
 * <ul>
 * <li>all public fields are final; and</li>
 * <li>all public final reference fields refer to other immutable objects; and</li>
 * <li>constructors and methods do not publish references to any internal state which is potentially mutable by the
 * implementation.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
