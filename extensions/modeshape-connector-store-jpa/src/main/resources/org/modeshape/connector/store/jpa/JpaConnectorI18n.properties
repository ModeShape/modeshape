cacheTimeToLiveInMillisecondsPropertyCategory = Database

largeValueSizeInBytesPropertyDescription = An advanced boolean property that controls the size of property values at which they are considered to be "large values". Depending upon the model, large property values may be stored in a centralized area and keyed by a secure hash of the value. This is an space and performance optimization that stores each unique large value only once. The default value is "1024" bytes, or 1 kilobyte.

referentialIntegrityEnforcedPropertyLabel = Referential Integrity
referentialIntegrityEnforcedPropertyCategory = Database

autoGenerateSchemaPropertyDescription = Sets the Hibernate setting dictating what it does with the database schema upon first connection. Valid values are:\n"create" - Create the database schema objects when the EntityManagerFactory is created (actually when Hibernate's SessionFactory is created by the entity manager factory). If a file named "import.sql" exists in the root of the class path (e.g., '/import.sql') Hibernate will read and execute the SQL statements in this file after it has created the database objects. Note that Hibernate first delete all tables, constraints, or any other database object that is going to be created in the process of building the schema.\n"create-drop" - Same as "create", except that the schema will be dropped after the EntityManagerFactory is closed.\n"update" - Attempt to update the database structure to the current mapping (but does not read and invoke the SQL statements from "import.sql"). Use with caution.\n"validate" - Validates the existing schema with the current entities configuration, but does not make any changes to the schema (and does not read and invoke the SQL statements from "import.sql"). This is often the proper setting to use in production, and thus this is the default value.
autoGenerateSchemaPropertyLabel = Autogenerate Schema
autoGenerateSchemaPropertyCategory = Database

modelNamePropertyDescription = Specifies the type of storage schema that is used. Currently, the only supported value is "Simple".
modelNamePropertyLabel = Storage Schema
modelNamePropertyCategory = Database
