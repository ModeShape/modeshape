 * The classes that make up the connector that stores content in a deployed instance of Infinispan. 
 * Infinispan is an extremely scalable, highly available data grid platform that distributes the data across 
 * the nodes in the grid. This connector makes it possible for repository content to be stored in a very efficient, 
 * fast, higly-concurrent (essentially lock- and synchronization-free) and reliable manner, even when the content 
 * size grows to massive sizes.
