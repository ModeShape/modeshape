/**

 * conditions that define the acceptable patterns for the paths of changed nodes, as well as a path specification that defines
 * where the derived (or generated) output should be placed. Then when clients change nodes with paths that satisfy the match
 * conditions, the repository will create a new Session and invoke the sequencer, which is then expected to process the changed
 * content and generate the derived information under the supplied parent node. The session will be saved automatically or, if an
 * exception is thrown, discard the changes and close the session.
